## TDD Methodology Followed

### RED Phase Implementation ✅
- **All 125 tests are designed to FAIL** initially
- Tests define the expected behavior before implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage across all feature requirements
- Mock objects and supporting types created for testing infrastructure

### Expected GREEN Phase (Next)
- Implement actual production code to make tests pass
- Start with `AnalyticsRepository` and data models
- Implement SwiftUI views and ViewModels
- Add Core Data schema and persistence
- Implement export functionality
- Add privacy compliance systems

### Expected REFACTOR Phase (Final)
- Optimize performance to meet strict timing requirements
- Refactor for maintainability and code quality
- Ensure all tests remain green during refactoring
