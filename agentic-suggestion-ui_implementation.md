    public let confidenceVisualization: ConfidenceVisualization
    public let complianceContext: ComplianceContext?
    public let estimatedTimeImpact: TimeInterval
    public let riskLevel: RiskLevel
    
    public init(from decisionResponse: DecisionResponse, 
                complianceContext: ComplianceContext? = nil) {
        // Transform DecisionResponse for UI display
    }
}
```

#### Enhanced Feedback Structures

**Purpose**: Extend existing `AgenticUserFeedback` with UI-specific metadata.

```swift
public struct EnhancedFeedbackResponse {
    public let baseFeedback: AgenticUserFeedback
    public let modificationDetails: ModificationDetails?
    public let contextualData: [String: Any]

        public let reasonForChange: String?
    }
}
```

### API Design

#### Enhanced Architecture (Consensus-Driven)

**Purpose**: Coordinate between UI components and existing agentic infrastructure with improved decoupling and security.

```swift
// Enhanced through consensus - Protocol-based architecture
public protocol DecisionProvider {
    func makeDecision(_ request: DecisionRequest) async throws -> DecisionResponse
    func provideFeedback(for decision: DecisionResponse, feedback: AgenticUserFeedback) async throws
}

// Consensus-driven addition - Real-time update decoupling
public actor SuggestionBus {
    private let confidenceSubject = PassthroughSubject<ConfidenceUpdate, Never>()
    private let feedbackSubject = PassthroughSubject<FeedbackUpdate, Never>()
    
    public var confidenceUpdates: AnyPublisher<ConfidenceUpdate, Never> {
        confidenceSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
    
    public var feedbackUpdates: AnyPublisher<FeedbackUpdate, Never> {
        feedbackSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}

public actor SuggestionService {
    private let decisionProvider: DecisionProvider
    private let complianceGuardian: ComplianceGuardian
    private let learningLoop: LearningFeedbackLoop
    private let suggestionBus: SuggestionBus
    private let securityValidator: SuggestionSecurityValidator
    
    public func generateSuggestions(
        for context: AcquisitionContext,
        withPreferences preferences: UserPreferences
    ) async throws -> [SuggestionDisplayModel] {
        // Enhanced through consensus - versioning and validation
        let validatedContext = try await securityValidator.validateContext(context)
        let decisions = try await decisionProvider.makeDecision(
            DecisionRequest(context: validatedContext, preferences: preferences)
        )
        return try await transformToDisplayModels(decisions)
    }
    
    public func submitFeedback(
        _ feedback: EnhancedFeedbackResponse
    ) async throws {
        // Enhanced through consensus - threat modeling applied
        let sanitizedFeedback = try await securityValidator.sanitizeFeedback(feedback)
        try await processFeedbackThroughAllSystems(sanitizedFeedback)
    }
}

// Consensus addition - Security validation
public actor SuggestionSecurityValidator {
    public func validateContext(_ context: AcquisitionContext) async throws -> AcquisitionContext {
        // Validate and sanitize context data
    }
    
    public func sanitizeFeedback(_ feedback: EnhancedFeedbackResponse) async throws -> EnhancedFeedbackResponse {
        // Prevent injection attacks in user modifications
    }
}
```
