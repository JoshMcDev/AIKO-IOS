## Review Criteria

### Critical Patterns to Check
Based on requirements analysis, these patterns are critical:
- [ ] Force unwrapping in MLX Swift model operations and Q-learning predictions
- [ ] Error handling for Q-network inference failures and model loading
- [ ] Security validation for user pattern storage and Core Data encryption
- [ ] Input validation for form field suggestions and context classification
- [ ] Authentication checks at adaptive feature access points

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Methods under 20 lines (critical for Q-learning algorithm readability)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 (essential for ML pipeline maintainability)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials (critical for privacy compliance)
- [ ] Proper error propagation through Q-learning and MLX Swift operations
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation for user data and ML model inputs

### SOLID Principles Focus Areas
Based on design complexity:
- [ ] **SRP**: AdaptiveFormPopulationService coordination vs Q-learning logic separation
- [ ] **OCP**: Q-learning algorithm extensions without modifying core prediction logic
- [ ] **LSP**: Context classifier implementations must be substitutable
- [ ] **ISP**: Separate interfaces for Q-learning, context classification, and privacy controls
- [ ] **DIP**: MLX Swift model abstractions and Core Data dependency injection

### Security Review Points
From requirements analysis:
- [ ] Input validation for: Form field values, context classification data, user preferences
- [ ] Authentication checks at: Adaptive learning enable/disable, data export/deletion
- [ ] Authorization validation for: Q-learning model access, privacy control modifications
- [ ] Data encryption for: Q-tables, user modification patterns, MLX Swift models
- [ ] Adversarial attack prevention: Side-channel resistance, timing attack mitigation
- [ ] Privacy protection: Zero PII storage in Q-learning models, secure memory cleanup

### Performance Considerations
Based on requirements:
- [ ] Async operations for: Q-network inference, Core Data operations, context classification
- [ ] Caching opportunities: Q-value predictions, context classification results, MLX model compilation
- [ ] Memory management for: MLX Swift tensor operations, Q-table pruning, experience replay buffers
- [ ] MLX Swift optimization: GPU acceleration utilization, model quantization effectiveness

### Platform-Specific Patterns (iOS/macOS)
- [ ] Main thread operations validation for UI updates with confidence indicators
- [ ] Memory retention cycle prevention in Q-learning agent and MLX Swift operations
- [ ] SwiftUI state management patterns for adaptive form population UI
- [ ] Combine publisher/subscriber patterns for real-time learning feedback
- [ ] Core Data thread safety with concurrent Q-learning updates

### Machine Learning Specific Patterns
- [ ] **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**: EWC implementation, cross-context interference detection
- [ ] **Q-Learning Correctness**: Update rule implementation, exploration-exploitation balance
- [ ] **MLX Swift Integration**: Proper tensor operations, model compilation, GPU utilization
- [ ] **Context Classification**: Accuracy validation, confidence thresholding, fallback mechanisms
- [ ] **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: No PII in models, differential privacy noise injection

## AST-Grep Pattern Configuration
Verify these patterns exist in .claude/review-patterns.yml:
- force_unwrap (Critical) - Especially in MLX Swift operations
- missing_error_handling (Critical) - Q-network failures, MLX Swift errors
- unencrypted_storage (Critical) - Q-tables, user patterns must be encrypted
- hardcoded_secret (Critical) - No ML model parameters hardcoded
- adversarial_vulnerability (Critical) - Side-channel attack patterns
- long_method (Major) - Q-learning algorithms must be decomposed
- complex_conditional (Major) - Context classification logic
- solid_srp_violation (Major) - Coordinator vs learning logic separation
- solid_dip_violation (Major) - MLX Swift and Core Data abstractions
- catastrophic_forgetting_risk (Major) - Q-learning stability patterns

## Metrics Baseline
- Target Method Length: < 20 lines (critical for ML algorithm readability)
- Target Complexity: < 10 (essential for Q-learning maintainability)
- Target Test Coverage: > 90% (higher than standard due to ML complexity)
- Security Issues Tolerance: 0 (zero tolerance for privacy violations)
- Force Unwrap Tolerance: 0 (critical in ML inference pipelines)
- Critical Issue Tolerance: 0 (ML systems require higher quality standards)

## Requirements-Specific Patterns
Based on Adaptive Form Population with RL analysis:

### Q-Learning Implementation Patterns
- **State Representation**: Consistent hashing for (form_type, context, user_segment, temporal_context)
- **Action Selection**: Proper epsilon-greedy implementation with decay
- **Q-Value Updates**: Correct application of Bellman equation with learning rate
- **Experience Replay**: Efficient buffer management and sampling

### MLX Swift Integration Patterns
- **Model Loading**: Proper error handling for model compilation and loading failures
- **Tensor Operations**: Memory-efficient tensor creation and cleanup
- **GPU Acceleration**: Fallback mechanisms when GPU unavailable
- **Model Quantization**: Accuracy validation after compression

### Privacy Protection Patterns
- **Data Minimization**: No PII storage in learning components
- **Encryption**: All user patterns encrypted in Core Data
- **Secure Deletion**: Complete data cleanup when features disabled
- **Adversarial Resistance**: Protection against timing and side-channel attacks

### Context-Aware Adaptation Patterns
- **Domain Separation**: IT vs Construction context isolation
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Proper routing based on prediction confidence
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation to static suggestions
- **Cross-Context Contamination Prevention**: Validation that learning in one domain doesn't affect others

## Consensus-Enhanced Critical Areas
Based on 5-model consensus validation:

### Highest Priority (CRITICAL)
1. **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**
   - Validate EWC or similar technique implementation
   - Test cross-context interference detection
   - Verify long-term stability maintenance

2. **Adversarial Privacy Protection**
   - Review side-channel attack resistance
   - Validate timing attack mitigation
   - Check model inversion attack protection

3. **MLX Swift Performance Optimization**
   - Review GPU utilization patterns
   - Validate model quantization correctness
   - Check memory allocation efficiency

### High Priority
4. **User Trust Framework Implementation**
   - Review A/B testing infrastructure
   - Validate confidence indicator accuracy
   - Check explanation generation quality

5. **Chaos Engineering Resilience**
   - Review AgenticOrchestrator failure handling
   - Validate autonomous operation capabilities
   - Check recovery mechanism robustness

## Recommendations for Next Phase
Green Implementer should:
1. **Run catastrophic forgetting detection patterns first** - highest consensus priority
2. **Focus on adversarial privacy patterns** - zero tolerance for privacy violations
3. **Validate MLX Swift integration patterns** - framework-specific requirements
4. **Document any critical issues found** without fixing during green phase
5. **Create technical debt items** for refactor phase addressing consensus gaps
6. **Not fix issues during green phase** - only document them for systematic resolution
7. **Reference this criteria file**: codeReview_adaptive_form_population_rl_guardian.md
