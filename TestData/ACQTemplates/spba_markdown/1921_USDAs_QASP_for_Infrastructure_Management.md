1 Introduction
The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) contains the high-level IT managemen
requirements and strategies needed to manage and provide the proper quality of IT Infrastructure
Management Services for Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) rendered by the Contractor. I
focuses on “how” service quality will be delivered along with targets in the form of Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs define the parameters for the ITIL Service Delivery
and Support processes as well as for any IT operational management processes.
A detailed plan for each ITIL Service Delivery and Support area is then developed by the
Contractor (service supplier) to ensure that it meets the service quality requirements set forth in
he QASP.

2 Work Requirements
The detailed work requirements of the IT Management Services contract are set forth in the
Performance Work Statement and summarized in Appendix-B (“Performance Requirements
Summary versus Performance Metrics”) of this QASP. Specifically, in the table in Appendix-B,
Columns C specifies the Performance Objectives (Desired Outcomes) for respective PWS
sections.
In brief, the work requirements correspond to the following categories:
• Mission-critical goals and Scope of IT Infrastructure Management Services
• General Requirements
• Project and Program Managemen
• Network Services and Operations
• Telecommunications Suppor
• Helpdesk Suppor
• Facility Managemen
• Foreign Installations
• System Documentation and Operating Procedures
• Potential Requirements for the Future
• Deliverables and Reporting
• Quality Assurance
• Earned Value Managemen
The goal of the IT Infrastructure Management Services is to provide a high level of service
quality, as measured by a defined set of Key performance Indicators (KPIs) and surveillance
methodology specified in this QASP.

The Primary Methods of Surveillance

In general, cost-effective quality surveillance will involve a combinational use of the following
methods:
•

•
•
•
•

100 Percent Survey. This is recommended for mission critical issues and issues
related to actual system failures and incidents; otherwise, it is not cost-effective and is
oo stringent.
Random Sampling. Appropriate for recurring tasks or productions requirements.
Periodic Inspection. Use a pre-determined plan based on analyses of agency
resources and requirements.
Customer Input. Suitable for service-oriented tasks; use a standard form to
document.
Contractor Self-Reporting. Appropriate for tasks like system maintenance where
he contractor can provide system records collected by tracking and monitoring tools
of that document performance; for development projects, monthly reports can detail
problems encountered.

The specific applications of these surveillance methods to this IT Infrastructure Management
Services contract are described in sections 5 to 7 of this QASP.

4 Scope of Performance
The Scope of Performance (Performance Requirements) is specified in the Work Performance
Statement (PWS, sections 1 & 3), and summarized in Appendix-B
(“FAS PWS
Objectives/Requirements vs. Performance Metrics) of this QASP. Specifically, in the table in
appendix-B, Columns D specifies the “Performance Requirements” for respective PWS
sections.
It is the objective of this contract to fulfill the specified requirements as measured by the set of
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and surveillance methods specified in sections 5 to 7.

5 Performance Standards
The Performance Standards specified for measuring the performance of FAS IT Infrastructure
Support Services contract consist of a set of 15 Performance Metrics (Key Performance
Indicators – KPIs, labeled 1,2, 3,…., 15), falling under 8 main performance categories (labeled,
A, B, C,…., H), as follows:

Page 4

Category
A: Satisfaction Rating &
Evaluation
B: Infrastructure /Network
C: Operation & Maintenance
D: Help Desk

E: Reporting
F: Documentation & Process
G: Security
H: Inventory

Performance Metrics
(Key Performance Indicators -KPIs)

1. User Satisfaction Rating
2. Management Evaluation Rating
3. Availability
4. Time-to-Resolution
5. Maintenance/Backup Audi
6. Tier-1 Resolution
7. Tier-2 Resolution
8. First-Call Resolution
9. Caller Wait Time
10. Reporting Assessmen
11. Documentation & Process Audi
12. Risk Mitigation
13. Security Audi
14. Inventory Audi

The detailed definitions for the 154 performance are provided in a table in Appendix-A
(“Performance Evaluation Matrix”). Specifically:
• Column-D of the table in Appendix-A provides the definitions of the 15 performance
metrics.
• Column-C of the table shows, for each of the 14 metrics, the corresponding PWS sections
numbers, for which the respective Required Services are covered by the individual
metrics.
• Column-E of the table provide the specified Acceptable Quality level (AQL) which will
serve as performance target values for each of the 15 metrics.
• It is of particular interest to note that the Metric #3 (Management Evaluation on Contrac
Goals) attempts to assess contract achievement on the basis of:
a) Cost Reduction,
b) Technology innovation,
c) Milestones,
d) General Performance and
e) Environmental Impact.
Furthermore, in Appendix-B (“FAS PWS Objectives/Requirements vs. Performance Metrics”),
Column-E of the table provides an inverse mapping of the subsets of performance metrics, which
address the Performance Objectives (Desired Outcomes) of respective PWS sections.

6 Performance Evaluation Methodology
The performance evaluation will be conducted based on the specifications provided in columns
F, G and H of Appendix-A (Performance Evaluation Matrix):
• Column-F: Monitoring Method – specifying the measurement and surveillance
methods (100% and/or random sampling), reporting frequency (monthly or quarterly) or
measurement/tracking tools.
• Column-G: Incentives/Disincentives - specifying for points (+1 or -1) for measured
metrics meeting of not meeting the respective specified AQL target values.
• Column-H: Assigned Weightings- for providing additional assigned weightings (x1, x2
or x3) in accordance with the relative importance of the metrics for achieving FAS’s
missions, resulting in the fully weighted range of [- 24 to +24] points.
Performance Measurement and Evaluation. The performance metrics will be measured
every quarter.
•

During the Base Year, the performance metrics will be measured but the performance
scores will not be used for award term decisions (as incentive or penalty).
Nonetheless, quarterly measurements will be made to allow continuous improvemen
on contract performance.

•

At the end of the first Option Year, the average of the performance scores of the four
quarters of the year will be used for the first Award Term decision according the
Rating Scheme as stipulated in c). Similarly, at the end of the second Option Year, the
averaged score of the year will be used for the second Award Term decision.

7 Incentives (Positive and/or Negative)
Using the Performance Evaluation Methodology (Section 6), a Composite Annual Score is
computed by taking the average of the four quarterly scores, and rated against the possible full
range of [-24 to +24] points.

Award Term (positive and/or negative) will be determined in accordance with the following
Rating Scheme:
¾ Excellent : [+21 to +24] points receives 1 full year
¾ Good : [+17 to +20] points receive half year
Page 6

¾ Satisfactory : [+13 to +16] points is neutral
¾ Marginal : [+9 to +12] points is penalized half year
¾ Unsatisfactory : less than or equal to +8 points is penalized 1 full year
More specific Award Term contract clauses are provided in the Contract and PWS documents.

"HELPFUL HINTS:
1. This QASP includes measurement of a significant number of reports and large amounts of
data. Trying to measure too many things may be unwieldy and inefficient.
2. Take note of how the performance standards are weighted in Appendix A, page 9. This is a
creative way to let the contractor know what's most important.
3. Appendix B repeats most, if not all,of the PWS. While it isn't incorrect, there may be a better
way to incorporate these elements without repeating them.
