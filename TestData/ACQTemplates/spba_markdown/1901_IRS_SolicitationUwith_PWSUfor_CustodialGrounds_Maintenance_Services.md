Page E - 1

TIRSE-05-C-00003

E.4 CONTRACT SURVEILLANCE:
The Government will execute a quality assurance program using surveillance
echniques and levels of inspection deemed appropriate to assure contract compliance. The
Government may change surveillance methods or levels of inspection at any time. The
Government's Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is provided as Exhibit 5 of Section J.
When random sampling is used for surveillance, payment for unsatisfactory performance will be
adjusted by the observed nonconforming items projected across the total population of services
for the invoice period, adjusted for specific work satisfactorily re-performed. Observed defects
external to the sample will not be used as a basis for deduction projection, but will be
considered in payment for rework. The projected defect rate will be adjusted in the Contractor's
favor by rounding down to the nearest whole number to establish a more statistically confiden
indication of the Contractor's true performance.
When other than random sampling is used for surveillance, payment for unsatisfactory
performance of work will be adjusted by those nonconforming work items actually observed and
which were not re-performed.
When surveillance efforts indicate that the Contractor's performance is unsatisfactory, the
Contractor will be notified and appropriate administrative fees will be taken in addition to the
payment deductions discussed above. The Contractor shall be assessed an administrative fee
for surveillance of unsatisfactory work in accordance with the Payment Deduction Clause
below:
E.5 PAYMENT REDUCTION CLAUSE
1. REDUCTIONS FOR UNSATISFACTORY OR NON-PERFORMED WORK
All contractually specified work is subject to inspection by the COTR or a duly
authorized representative. If work is found unsatisfactory as a result of these inspections the
Government may reduce payments to the Contractor by an amount equal to the value of the
unsatisfactory or non-performed work, as determined by the Contracting Officer using the
procedures described in the following paragraphs. Payment may be deducted from any
payment due the Contractor. In the event the Contractor disagrees with the Contracting Officer
as to any reduction, such disagreement shall be subject to the contract clause entitled
"Disputes".
2. ADJUSTING PAYMENTS
(a) Under the Inspection of Services clause (FAR 52.246-4) of this contract, payments
may be adjusted if any services do not conform to contract requirements. The Contracting
Officer will inform the Contractor, in writing, of the type and dollar amount of proposed
deductions by the 15th workday of the month following the performance period for which the
deductions are to be made.
(b) The Contractor may, within 10 working days of receipt of the notification of the
proposed deductions, present to the Contracting Officer specific reasons why any or all of the
proposed deductions are not justified. Reasons must be solidly based and must provide
specific facts that justify reconsideration and/or adjustment of the amount to be deducted.

Page E - 2

TIRSE-05-C-00003
Failure to respond within the 10-day period will be interpreted to mean that the Contractor
accepts the deduction as proposed.
(c) All or a portion of the final payment may be delayed or withheld until the Contracting
Officer makes a final decision on the proposed deduction. If the Contracting Officer determines
hat any or all of the proposed deductions are warranted, the Contracting Officer shall so notify
he Contractor, and adjust subsequent payments under the contract accordingly
3. DEDUCTIONS
(a) Inspection sheets prepared by Government Inspectors shall identify work inspected and
indicate if performance is satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Any task identified as critical that is no
performed or re-performed satisfactorily will result in the entire space inspected being
determined unsatisfactory and is subject to the application of deductions. In large open areas,
he building support columns or other obvious dividers will be considered in determining the
composition of an individual office when deductions are being made.
(b) Deductions will be applied at a fixed rate per 1000 square feet of space determined
unsatisfactory. For custodial services, the rate will be calculated using the fixed monthly rate
for basic services and total net cleaning space of 290,549 currently 277,588 square feet for the
4800 Building and 4466 for the Childcare Center. The deduction rate for grounds maintenance
will be calculated using the fixed monthly rate for grounds maintenance and 640,121 square
feet, total outside area to be maintained for both locations. These rates will need to be
recalculated if the monthly rate changes as a result of increased costs or changes in the space
o be maintained.
## EXAMPLE OF DEDUCTION RATE CALCULATION
The following calculation is based on a monthly rate of $101,406 and area to be maintained of
290,549 square feet.
1. Monthly rate divided by square feet: $101,406 divided by 290,549 = $.35 per square foot per
month
2. Monthly rate of $.35 per square foot divided by 21 workdays = $.0166 per square foot per
day
3. Square foot per day rate of $.0166 multiplied by 1000 = $16.60 per 1000 square fee
EXCEPTIONS TO SQUARE FEET: If computing reductions for failure to perform a certain task
and square feet do not apply other methods may be used to arrive at the area not serviced,
e.g.:
1. Emptying or cleaning trashcans, the area that the container is considered to serve
will be considered 1000 square feet.
2. Edging and trimming, linear feet may be used.
(c) APPLICATION OF DEDUCTIONS (Non-Performance)
(1) Daily Services - If the Contractor fails to perform satisfactorily or omits work required
for performance, the Contractor's attention shall be called to this failure or omission.
Deductions may be made from any monies due or to become due to the Contractor to cover the
cost of the service omitted or not satisfactorily performed. Costs to be deducted under this

Page E - 3

TIRSE-05-C-00003
paragraph will be determined by using the deduction rate calculated in accordance with the
instructions above. Deductions may be applied for each day that service is not performed or
remains unsatisfactory.
(2) Periodic Services - If the Contractor fails to perform satisfactorily, omits, or fails to
reschedule tasks as outlined in the Contractor's approved periodic schedule, the Contracting
Officer or his designated representative shall give the Contractor written notice of the failure or
omission. Once notified, if the Contractor does not complete the work within the time allotted
by the Contracting Officer or his designated representative the work may be performed by other
means and the cost thereof shall be deducted from monies due or to become due the
Contractor. Failure of the Contractor to perform, or if the omitted or unsatisfactory work canno
be rescheduled, deductions for the total amount of unsatisfactory space at the calculated
deduction rate will be taken from any monies due or to become due the Contractor.
(3) Quality Control Inspections - In the event the scheduled inspections as identified in
he approved quality control program are not accomplished, a deduction shall be made from
any monies due or to become due to the Contractor. The Government will determine the time
(man-hours) necessary to make the inspection, including any travel time required and multiply
he total by the current hourly rate for supervisors.
(4) Withholding Monies for Non-Submission of Work Schedules - The Contractor is
required to submit an acceptable quality control program and/or an annual schedule of periodic
service by dates and areas not later than the contract performance date. The Contracting
Officer (CO) or the designated representative may grant an extension. In the event the
schedules are not received and approved by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative
(COTR) by the date required, the COTR may recommend to the CO withholding of all payments
until the submittals are received and approved. The CO will notify the Contractor in writing in
he event that payments are withheld.
E.6 INSPECTION, ACCEPTANCE AND RECEIVING CERTIFICATION

representative, will place a statement substantially the same as follows on the file copy of the
Contractor's invoice:

Example:
1. Monthly rate $101,406 divided by square feet of 290,549 = $.35 per square foot per month
2. Monthly rate of $.35 per square foot divided by 21 workdays = $.0166 per square foot per
day
3. Square foot per day rate of $.0166 multiplied by 1000 = $16.60 per 1000 square feet per day
This rate will be multiplied by the square feet of the unoccupied space or area not being
maintained.
Example: 2500 square feet divided by 1000 = 2.5 multiplied by $16.60 (rate per 1000 square
feet) = $41.50 per day.
The daily rate will be multiplied by the number of days that the space is not maintained, e.g.:
For 2500 square feet of space not maintained for one month the adjustment will be $871.50, 21
workdays in a month multiplied by the daily rate for 2500 square feet, $41.50.
G.4 FINAL PAYMENT
Before final payment is made, the Contractor shall furnish the Contacting Officer with a release
of all claims against the Government relating to this contract, other than claims in stated
amounts that are specifically excepted by the contractor form the release. If the Contractor's
claim to amounts payable under the contract has been assigned under the Assignment of
Claims Act of 1940, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15), a release may also be
required of the assignee.
The final (last) payment will be delayed approximately 45 days to ensure all necessary

echnical discipline. The following examples are not intended to be all inclusive, to
limit the application of the professional or technical exemption provided in the law, or
o limit the exemption to licensed professionals. For example, drafting of a legal
document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly,
echnical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational
capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is
allowable. However, communication with a technical person (such as a licensed
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and
analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the
advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or
negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communication with the
intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, bu
generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section
because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly,
communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an
engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of an bid or proposal are
not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services bu
not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

Exhibit J-5
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
Atlanta Submission Processing Center
Atlanta, GA
Note: This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is provided for information
only and does not need to be addressed in Offerors' proposal.
1. PURPOSE: This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed and
designed to aid the COTR in providing effective and systematic surveillance of all aspects
of the custodial services and grounds maintenance required by the contract. This plan is
provided for information only and may be changed at any time. This plan provides for
monitoring all contract requirements through a combination of the following methods:
a. Sampling Guides (attached);
b. Surveillance Activity Checklists;
c. Unscheduled Inspections; and
d. Validated Customer Complaints
2. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this QASP is to provide detail on how the IRS will inspec
and evaluate the contractor's performance in key areas. The Government is primarily
interested in both timeliness and quality of performance. This plan will focus on the level of
performance required by the statement of work, rather than the methodology used by the
contractor to achieve that level of performance. The principal method of surveillance will be
by unscheduled inspections of selected tasks as they are performed.
3. CONTRACT INSPECTORS: Contract Inspectors for this contract are employees of the
Internal Revenue Service's Building Delegation Section at the IRS Atlanta Submission
Center and are responsible for the day to day inspection and monitoring of the Contractor's
work. The responsibilities of the inspectors include, but are not limited to: inspecting the
work to insure compliance with the contract terms and conditions; documenting through
written inspection reports the results of all inspections conducted; following through to
assure that all defects or omissions are corrected; conferring with representatives of the
Contractor regarding any problems encountered in the performance of the work and
generally assisting the COTR in carrying out his responsibilities. The primary method of
inspection will be unscheduled inspections.
4. USE of the QASP:
a. The COTR will use the QASP to:
(1) as the basis for documentation of inspections as outlined in this surveillance
plan;
(2) ensure that adequate inspections are made to determine that Contractor is
providing service according to contracts terms and conditions.
(3) select tasks, areas, and times for inspection to ensure that all tasks and posts

Page J - 10

TIRSE-05-C-00003
are periodically inspected.
b. Monthly checklists will be used to record information on observations and defects.
Each defect observed will be recorded on the checklists. These documents will then
become a formal government record for later reference. The tally of defects
observed at the end of each month will be compared to the maximum allowable
degree of deviation. Any discrepancies detected during the course of the
surveillance, even if not of sufficient degree to render the service unsatisfactory in
erms of the maximum allowable degree of deviation, will require corrective action by
he contractor, if appropriate/ possible. Specifics concerning any errors will be
recorded in the “Remarks” area of the checklist(s). The Contractor’s representative
will be asked to initial any such entry.
c. If, at the conclusion of the month’s inspections, it is found that the number of
defects exceed the maximum allowable degree of deviation that service may be
considered unsatisfactory. If performance in any area is judged unsatisfactory,
based on scheduled inspections, the contractor will be given a Contract Discrepancy
Report (CDR) by the COTR. When completed and signed, the CDR, along with the
checklists, becomes the documentation supporting payment, reduced payment,
nonpayment, or other actions as necessary.
d. During the course of the month, the COTR may receive customer complaints abou
he quality of service. Each complaint received shall be validated by the COTR to the
extent feasible to ensure the service was required and that the standard was no
met. If surveillance shows that a specific service is unsatisfactory, customer
complaints may be used by the COTR as further evidence of unsatisfactory
performance.
5.

Evaluation Procedures.
a. Unscheduled Inspections Unscheduled inspections may be conducted at any time.
Performance defects observed during unscheduled inspections will be documented
on an inspection checklist. Inspectors may observe performance of any tasks a
anytime that work is being performed and evaluate performance of the Work
Requirements.
A Pass (P) or Fail (F) rating will be assigned each task inspected, based on the
Performance Criteria listed below. Any Work Requirement task reasonably
unavailable for inspection will receive a neutral rating. A brief description of
observed defects or actions taken will be

Customer Complaints: The Inspector will record and attempt to validate each
customer complaint received. Only complaints validated by the inspector will be
documented as an observed defect.
1. Documented Defects. Copies of documented performance defects will be
provided to the

Page J - 11

TIRSE-05-C-00003
Contractor within 24 hours of validation by the COTR. Performance defects
represent a loss in value to the Government and are subject to payment deductions.
Refer to Section E, Payment adjustment Clause.
Analysis of Results.
a. A the end of the month, the COTR will summarize the results of the inspections;
compare the number of satisfactory performance ratings to maximum allowable degree
of deviation for each Work Requirement and review documented defects, determine if
monitoring needs to be increased, and, calculate recommended payment deductions
for documented defects in accordance with the "Payment Adjustment Clause" in
Section E.
b. The COTR will monitor the Contractor's overall performance and recommend
appropriate administrative actions to the Contracting Officer when performance is less
han satisfactory.

TIRSE-05-C-00003
THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as
numbered):
1) Does not apply to employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative,
or professional capacity as defined and delineated in 29 CFR 541. (See CFR 4.156)
2) APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: An employee is
entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.
at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of
he rate of basic pay.
3) WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or

like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contrac
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do

Page J - 33

TIRSE-05-C-00003
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **
Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage
and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage
rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies
as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of
he wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The
relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties)
contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting
"arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a)
of the regulations. This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage
rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.
Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993, as
amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise indicated. This
publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, at 202-783-3238,
or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C. 20402. Copies of specific job descriptions may also be obtained
from the appropriate contracting officer.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by
he contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees

Page J - 34

TIRSE-05-C-00003
performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a repor
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the
request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
hat duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

HELPFUL HINTS FROM SEVEN STEPS TEAM: PWS does a good job of detailing WHAT has to be done, and
he performance measures and metrics described in Sections E and J (Att. 4 & 5) do a good job of explaining
how contractor performance will be evaluated. This will require the QA folks to clearly understand the
QASP, and follow it closely. Sec. C.5 should be reduced to say they need a qualified PM on site and that it is
he Contractor’s responsibility to provide trained employees.
