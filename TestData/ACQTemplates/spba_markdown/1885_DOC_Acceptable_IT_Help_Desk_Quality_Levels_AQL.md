HELPFUL HINTS OFFERED BY THE 7 STEPS TEAM:
1. This example has quite a few metrics, perhaps too many to manage effectively. Suggest reducing the number of critical
metrics to under 10.
2. Note that having the phone answered may not solve the problem; consider using “problem resolution” instead.
3. In order to meet the FAR 37.6 “litmus test” for PBSA, there must be a mechanism for price or fee reduction should the
agreed-upon performance levels not be reached.
