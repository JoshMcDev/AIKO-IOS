Guidebook
for
Performance-Based Services
Acquisition
(PBSA)
in the Department of Defense

December 2000

TOP-LEVEL GUIDING PRINCIPLES
To the maximum extent practicable, agencies shall use performance-based
methods for acquiring services.
Fixed-price, performance-based commercial service acquisitions are
complementary strategies that encourage commercial contractors to conduc
business with DoD.
Utilize a multi-functional acquisition team to the maximum extent practicable.
Support it with a knowledge management infrastructure.
Early planning is essential in determining requirements and assessing marke
conditions, and it should include the user and as many relevant acquisition team
members as possible.
To maximize returns for all stakeholders, acquisition strategies should be tailored
on the basis of experience, market research, and risk. Performance-Based
Services Acquisition (PBSA) is not a “one size fits all” process.
Strive to define requirements in clear, concise language. Focus on specific work
outcomes and ensure that they are measurable to the greatest exten
practicable.
Templates are only a partial solution. Sample work statements should be
individually tailored to the requirement, and for more complex requirements, work
statements should be uniquely crafted.
Through market research, public meetings, and draft solicitations, seek industry
comment and suggestions regarding performance objectives, standards, and
incentives.
Incentives should motivate a contractor to achieve performance levels of the
highest quality consistent with economic efficiency. Ensure that incentives are
effective and that they reflect value both to the government and to the contractor.
Contractor performance assessments (the process known as “quality
assurance”) should focus on outcomes rather than on contractor processes.
Focus on insight of the contractor performance, not oversight.
Periodic assessment of contractor performance should emphasize clear
communication, with the objective of encouraging and maintaining high
standards of performance, and it should be consistent with past performance
assessments.

INTRODUCTION
Policy
“It is the policy of the Department of Defense that, in order to maximize performance,
innovation and competition, often at a savings, performance based strategies for the
acquisition of services are to be used wherever possible. While not all acquisitions for
services can be conducted in a performance-based manner, the vast majority can.
Those cases in which performance-based strategies are not employed should become
he exception. In order to ensure that the Department continually realizes these savings
and performance gains, the DoD establishes, at a minimum, that 50 percent of service
acquisitions, measured in both dollars and actions, are to be performance-based by
year 2005.” – Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology & Logistics (USD
(AT&L)), April 5, 2000.
PBSA Definition
PBSA involves acquisition strategies, methods, and techniques that describe and
communicate measurable outcomes rather than direct performance processes. It is
structured around defining a service requirement in terms of performance objectives
and providing contractors the latitude to determine how to meet those objectives.
Simply put, it is a method for acquiring what is required and placing the responsibility for
how it is accomplished on the contractor.
To be considered performance-based, an acquisition should contain, at a minimum, the
following elements
1. Performance work statement—Describes the requirement in terms of measurable
outcomes rather than by means of prescriptive methods.
2. Measurable performance standards—To determine whether performance
outcomes have been met, defines what is considered acceptable performance.
3. Remedies—Procedures that address how to manage performance that does no
meet performance standards. While not mandatory, incentives should be used,
where appropriate, to encourage performance that will exceed performance
standards. Remedies and incentives complement each other.
4. Performance Assessment Plan—Describes how contractor performance will be
measured and assessed against performance standards. (Quality Assurance Plan or
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan) .
Objectives of PBSA
By describing requirements in terms of performance outcomes, agencies can help
achieve the following objectives:

1

Maximize performance: Allows a contractor to deliver the required service by following
its own best practices. Since the prime focus is on the end result, contractors can
adjust their processes, as appropriate, through the life of the contract without the burden
of contract modifications provided that the delivered service (outcome) remains in
accordance with the contract. The use of incentives further motivates contractors to
furnish the best performance of which they are capable.
Maximize competition and innovation: Encouraging innovation from the supplier
base by using performance requirements maximizes opportunities for competitive
alternatives in lieu of government-directed solutions. Since PBSA allows for greater
innovation, it has the potential to attract a broader industry base.
Encourage and promote the use of commercial services: The vast majority of
service requirements are commercial in nature. Use of FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of
Commercial Items) procedures provides great benefits by minimizing the reporting
burden and reducing the use of government-unique contract clauses and similar
requirements, which can help attract a broader industry base.
Shift in risk: Much of the risk is shifted from the government to industry, since
contractors become responsible for achieving the objectives in the work statemen
hrough the use of their own best practices and processes. Agencies should consider
his reality in determining the appropriate acquisition incentives.
Achieve savings: Experience in both government and industry has demonstrated tha
use of performance requirements results in cost savings.
PBSA Team
The PBSA team should be a customer-focused, multi-functional team that plans and
manages service contracts throughout the life of the requirement. The requirement may
be for a single function or for multiple functions. Estimated dollar value should not be
he sole determinant of the amount of effort devoted to the acquisition. Previously, i
was common for contracting and other functional experts to work independently in
acquiring services. This should be a thing of the past. It is essential that all
stakeholders—users/customers, acquisition personnel, and industry—be involved
hroughout the service acquisition life cycle , from the requirements analysis phase
hrough contract award and administration. The duties, expertise, and contributions of
each PBSA team member are important to the success of a service acquisition. Many
functional experts can make up an acquisition team, as noted below. The description of
heir duties is not all-inclusive.
Customer/User: Responsible for defining the requirement, including an assessment of
he risk that the government might assume when relying on commercial specifications
and common marketplace performance and quality standards. The customer/user also
plays an important role in deciding what tradeoffs can be made when considering a
commercially available service to fulfill an agency requirement.

2

Technical specialist/project manager/program manager: These people serve as the
principal technical experts and are usually the most familiar with the requirement and
best able to identify potential technical tradeoffs and determine whether the requiremen
can be met by a commercial solution.
Contracting officer/contract specialist: Serves as the principal business advisor and
principal agent for the government responsible for developing the solicitation,
conducting the source selection, and managing the resultant contract and business
arrangement. This individual researches contracts in the marketplace to identify
general business practices such as commercial terms and conditions, contract type, bid
schedule breakout, and the use of incentives.
Cost/price analyst: Analyzes and evaluates financial price- and cost-based data for
reasonableness, completeness, accuracy, and affordability. Alternatively, some
agencies utilize cost engineering personnel from within an engineering division to
conduct cost/price analysis from a technical standpoint.
Performance assessment personnel (quality assurance personnel): Performance
assessment personnel are known by many names, such as quality assurance evaluator
(QAE), contracting officer’s representative (COR), or contracting officer’s technical
representative (COTR), but their duties are essentially the same. They serve as the onsite technical managers assessing contractor performance against contrac
performance standards. Performance assessment personnel are responsible for
researching the marketplace to remain current with the most efficient and effective
performance assessment methods and techniques.
Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU) Specialist: Serves as the
principal advisor and advocate for small business issues. Also serves as the liaison
with the Small Business Administration (SBA).
Finance/budget officer: Serves as an advisor for fiscal and budgetary issues.
Legal advisor: Ensures that the commercial practices and terms and conditions
contemplated are consistent with the government‘s legal rights, duties, and
responsibilities. Reviews for legal sufficiency and advises on acquisition strategies and
contract.
Miscellaneous others: Personnel from outside the agency may also be useful,
depending on their area of expertise. These include people from agencies such as the
Defense Logistics Agency, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Finance
and Accounting Service, the Defense Contract Management Agency, and the
Environmental Protection Agency, to name a few.
The Business Relationship with the Contractor
A positive relationship between the government and the contractor is essential in
fulfilling a performance-based requirement. The agency’s relationship with prospective

3

and performing contractors should be one that promotes a strong and positive business
alliance to achieve mutually beneficial goals—such as timely delivery and acceptance of
high-quality services—through the use of efficient business practices. Business
relationships should seek to create a cooperative environment to ensure effective
communication between the parties, teamwork, cooperation, and good-faith
performance. These are important for meeting mission objectives and resolving
conflicts and problems. Each party should clearly understand the goals, objectives, and
needs of the other. It is essential that government and industry work together as a team
o communicate expectations, agree on common goals, and identify and address
problems early on to achieve desirable outcomes.

MARKET RESEARCH
Introduction
Market research is the process of collecting and analyzing information on commercial
capabilities, processes, pricing , incentives, warranties, and delivery and other standard
erms and conditions. This information is needed in order to determine the suitability of
he marketplace for satisfying a need or requirement. The ultimate goal of marke
research is to help the acquisition team become informed consumers. Information
derived from market research will help the acquisition team develop the optimum
strategy for meeting the requirement. This section will focus on market research as i
applies to PBSA.
Benefits of Market Research
•

Helps determine whether the service is commercially available.

•

Helps the acquisition team understand what alternative solutions the
marketplace can provide.

•

Can provide insight regarding potential price expectations.

•

Helps specify or describe agency needs.

•

Serves as the gateway for keeping abreast of the latest in technology and
current market trends.

•

Assists in overall acquisition planning.

Market Research and the PBSA Process
There is no single , stand-alone step for market research in the PBSA process. Marke
research is a continuous process that should be revisited throughout the acquisition life
cycle. Consider the following:
Preaward: Before any documents such as the performance work statement are
developed, market research should be conducted to obtain information about alternative
solutions that may be available from the marketplace today. Once the requirement has
been thoroughly analyzed (as described in the preceding section) market research is
also useful in developing, validating, and refining the Performance Requirements
Summary for the performance work statement.
Postaward: Some commercial market areas and their practices are continually
evolving, being reshaped, and responding to various trends in the market, (e.g.,
information technology). Therefore, market research is useful after contract award to
ensure that the current acquisition strategy or business arrangement remains effective
in terms of price, schedule, and technical excellence.

5

Roles and Responsibilities in Market Research
Since market research should address both business and technical considerations of a
requirement, it requires the active participation of all acquisition team members as
appropriate. These considerations might include technical approaches, common quality
controls, contract structure, and standard industry terms and conditions. Therefore,
when market research is being conducted, all members of the acquisition team should
participate, as appropriate to their area of expertise.
Conducting Market Research
There are no specific procedures for performing market research; it should be tailored
or adjusted to each acquisition. Different kinds of services may call for differen
approaches. The objective is to become informed about and well-versed in the
particular service industry that will be providing the requirement. Therefore, the key is
o be creative yet thorough. While not the only means of accomplishing marke
research, consider the following:
•

Determine what information is necessary. (What do I need to know, and what kinds
of questions will I need to ask to obtain it?)

•

Locate informational sources where you might find specific points of contact to start
market research, such as the Internet, industry associations, trade journals, and
sources-sought synopses. Developing sources of information can be accomplished
hrough group brainstorming , and it may require more than one brainstorming
session.

•

Define a list of sources, eventually narrowing it down to government and industry
contacts that can provide specific information relevant to satisfying the requirement.
Appendix G sets forth a list of Internet sites that may assist the acquisition team.

•

Develop survey questions. Doing so helps to consider and capture all those
items requiring investigation and research.

•

Use the survey questions as a scripted point of reference for interviewing
sources. Set a time line and discuss your results with the acquisition team.

Sample Survey Questions
•

What is the normal length of a contract for the services being contemplated?
Are there any special terms and conditions?

•

Which services should be required on-site? Which can be provided off-site?

•

What kinds of factors are used to evaluate service providers?

•

What kinds of performance incentives are used?

•

What kinds of performance assessment methods are commonly used?

6

•

Who are your frequent customers? (Try to get a point of contact.)

•

Who owns or furnishes needed equipment and supplies?

•

What are the common qualifications of the people who are providing the
services?

The answers to these questions will help you build performance objectives,
performance standards, and other elements in the PBSA process or at least will allow
you to be better informed. The more the acquisition team knows about the particular
service industry, the more likely the team can best articulate the requirement in
performance-based terms.
Keep in mind that contractors or vendors are not required to provide any information.
Any furnishing of information is strictly voluntary. As a rule, information on standard
commercial practices will not be proprietary. However, if vendors provide any
information that they consider proprietary, agencies must afford the same protection to
hat information that they afford to proprietary information submitted as part of a
proposal.
TIP: Review the results of recent or previous market research. Consider results from
other agencies that have acquired similar services.
•

TIP:

•

TIP:
Contact knowledgeable individuals in the government and industry.
Discuss relevant best practices and acquisition strategies.

•

TIP:

Obtain source listings (yellow pages, Internet Web sites, etc.).

•

TIP:

Query any known government and commercial databases.

•

TIP:
Publish formal requests for information (RFIs) in the Commerce
Business Daily (CBD) or in other electronic posting systems. However, keep
in mind that the CBD may not be the best mode for reaching those
commercial companies that normally don’t do business with the government.

•

TIP:

•

TIP:
Host pre-solicitation industry exchanges commensurate with the
size and complexity of the requirement.

•

TIP:
Keep current with industry solutions in your area of expertise by
attending symposiums, trade shows, etc.

Start early and involve all key players in the acquisition process.

Review vendor publications/catalogs.

DEVELOPING A PERFORMANCE-BASED WORK STATEMENT AND
## ESTABLISHING MEASURABLE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Introduction
The key to using performance-based methodologies is describing requirements as
outcomes and not in terms of how to accomplish the requirement. Therefore, a
performance based work statement must be carefully structured to ensure that the
requirement is articulated in this manner. Accordingly, the acquisition team will conduc
a series of in-depth analyses to understand the requirement fully in order to be able to
articulate the desired outcomes.
Performance Requirement Analysis
Developing a performance work statement involves a series of analysis-oriented steps
o help identify and define the requirement.
1. Define the desired outcomes. What must be accomplished to satisfy the
requirement?
To define desired outcomes, list what needs to be accomplished in order to satisfy the
overall requirement, from a top-level perspective. Use an interview or brainstorming
approach with the customer (user) to determine all dependent variables (what, when,
where, who, quantity, quality levels , etc.) to ensure that all unique requirements have
been considered. For some requirements, you may simply be reviewing previous
requirements for validity and accuracy. For example:
Custodial requiremen
- clean office administration building
– clean office training building
– clean office physics lab
Pre-hardware developmen
– conceptual design
– component developmen
– design
– fabrication
– testing
– reporting requirements
2. On the basis of the desired outcomes defined in step 1, conduct an outcome
analysis to identify performance objectives. What tasks must be accomplished
o arrive at the desired outcomes?
An outcome analysis is the process that identifies specific performance objectives for
hose outcomes defined in the previous step. Performance objectives are the specific

8

services that you want performed and delivered by the contractor, defined in terms of
he outcomes. This step differs from the previous step in that it goes into greater detail
and expands the analysis beyond the top-level perspective. The goal is to describe
adequately what is expected in accomplishing the requirement (not how to accomplish
it).
You should start by segregating desired outcomes into lower task levels and linking
hose tasks together into a logical flow of activities. Using a tree diagram to outline
each of the basic outcomes (those top-level perspectives) is recommended in order to
ensure that you have considered all critical elements of the requirement. Appendix A is
a tree diagram that illustrates the intent of this step.
TIP:

Keep in mind that there may not have to be a performance objective (a need to
get into greater detail) for each task specified, especially those tasks at the lower
ask levels. The performance objective of lower tasks may be inherent in the
higher level tasks and thus may be captured at that higher level. You should go
only as low as you have to in order to describe the requirement adequately.

TIP:

Ensure that each performance objective is necessary and carefully chosen. Try
not to make any performance objective unduly burdensome or restrictive.
Restrictive performance objectives are often pricey and may result in delivery of
unnecessary requirements at a high price. However, if it is absolutely necessary
in order to meet the mission, proceed accordingly.

3. On the basis of the performance objectives identified in step 2, conduct a
performance analysis to identify the appropriate performance standards and
acceptable quality levels (AQLs). When or how will I know that the outcome has
been satisfactorily achieved, and how much deviation from the performance
standard will I allow the contractor, if any?
A performance analysis is a process that identifies how a performance objective should
be measured and, thus, what performance standards, (e.g., timeliness or quality levels)
are appropriate and reasonable for that particular performance objective. In this step,
you may also identify AQLs, also known as thresholds. Performance standards and
AQLs are very important in that they identify acceptable levels of performance.
Developing and setting performance standards and AQLs are judgment calls based on
he needs of the mission, available expertise, and market research. The members of
he acquisition team should work closely with each other when developing standards
and AQLs. See Appendix C for examples of performance standards and AQLs.
AQLs constitute a minimally acceptable level of performance and are typically stated as
a percentage of required conformances (e.g., clean, 95% of the time) or as a number of
permissible deviations (e.g., 1 error per x time period). In developing AQLs, you are
asking, “What minimum level of quality do I need to meet my mission needs?” Keep in
mind that not every performance standard may have an AQL. When a performance
standard does not include an AQL, then you are stating that no deviations are allowed
in meeting the performance outcome (see the tips below).

9

TIP:

Exercise care in establishing AQLs for performance standards. Often, the closer
o 100 percent perfection, then the higher the price. It is also important to ensure
hat performance standards are measurable. Think carefully when establishing a
100 percent standard (or not establishing deviations), since this threshold can
directly affect the price. 100 percent AQLs (thresholds) can be unreasonable or
unrealistic for some performance objectives. However, if the performance
objective is critical (for instance, if it covers a life-threatening matter), 100 percen
is acceptable. Conversely, if the AQL is set too low, it could act as a disincentive
o good contract performance.

TIP:

Market research may be helpful for this area. It might reveal that a particular
service area may have specific, commercially acceptable performance standards
hat as expressed in terms other than percentages or deviations. It is generally
wise to use commercial standards unless otherwise inappropriate for the
requirement. You might find it necessary to establish your own performance
standards. It’s a good idea to employ industry input or review of agency
standards to ensure that measures are realistic and effective. This may be
accomplished through public meetings, public comment on proposed standards,
or draft solicitations. The contracting officer should serve as a business advisor
o guide the team on the use of commercial performance standards.

Examples of Performance Standards
•

Response times, delivery times, timeliness – meeting deadlines or due dates,
adherence to schedule.

•

Error rates – number of mistakes/errors allowed in meeting the performance
standard.

•

Accuracy rates – similar to error rates, but most often stated in terms of
percentages.

•

Completion milestone rates – x percent complete at a given date.

•

Cost control – keeping within the estimated cost or target cost. Applies in
cost-reimbursement contract arrangement.

Performance Requirements Summary
The desired outcomes, performance objectives, performance standards, and AQLs, tha
have been developed through the previously explained analyses are then documented
in a Performance Requirements Summary (PRS). See Appendix B for a sample PRS
matrix. The PRS will be the baseline for the performance work statement. PRSs
should be brief and should capture the salient elements of the requirement. In the
actual performance work statement, the acquisition team will elaborate on and describe
he requirement in greater detail. The ultimate goal is to describe the requirement in a
way that allows an offeror to understand fully what will be necessary to accomplish it.
Appendix C contains several samples of PRSs.

10

NOTE: Many of the samples in Appendix C come from various agencies and other
sources. Performance objectives and performance standards are sometimes combined
in one tasking sentence. Likewise, performance standards and AQLs can also be
combined. There is no preferred format. Agencies should ensure only that PRSs and
performance work statements fully communicate the expectation using the appropriate
performance-based service acquisition elements.
Performance Work Statement (PWS)
In the actual work statement, the acquisition team will elaborate on the contents of the
PRS and describe the requirement in such a way that offerors will be able to understand
fully from their point of view, what will be necessary to accomplish the requirement.
Issuing a draft PRS is always a good way of obtaining industry feedback in order to
achieve the best-quality work statement. Expect the PWS to evolve as a result of this
feedback. It is also important to allow adequate time for meaningful exchanges with
industry. (See Appendix ___.)
Manpower Requirements and Labor Category Descriptions
As reiterated throughout this guidebook, the key to performance-based acquisition is
describing requirements in terms of measurable outcomes and not in terms of how to
accomplish the requirement. This applies equally to labor category descriptions.
Previously, manpower requirements were commonly prescribed in terms of “required
number of bodies” or by using other qualifiers such as college degrees or specific years
of experience. Prescribing manpower requirements limits the ability of offerors to
propose their best solutions, and it could preclude the use of qualified contractor
personnel who may be well suited for performing the requirement but may be lacking—
for example—a complete college degree or the exact years of specified experience.
Instead, the requirement should be described in a way that allows offerors to meet the
requirement by applying alternative sets of resources. Offerors can then propose their
best solutions for manpower requirements, in accordance with the described
requirement. Once the offeror submits its proposal, the acquisition team will evaluate
he offeror’s proposal, including manpower solutions , for best value.
Since performance-based acquisition methodologies are results-oriented, agencies
should not focus on contractor-proposed labor mixes after contract award, as long as
he desired outcome is achieved in accordance with the stated performance standards
and any other requirements in the contract.
Historical and Projected Workload Data
Consider including historical and projected workload data and any surge requirements
in the PWS, as applicable. See Appendix E for an example. This type of information
allows prospective contractors to predict manpower and supply needs more accurately
as they relate to the specific requirement and thus to develop more realistic proposals.

11

While historical data are often useful, it is important to remember that they merely
describe past experience and may not necessarily be indicative of the future.
Workload data are often available from existing management information systems,
databases, and records. If workload data are not available, consider consulting with
other agencies to obtain information on similar requirements. Some agencies
incorporate in PWSs a requirement to maintain accurate workload data that can be
useful for future contract work estimates.
Performance Work Statement Review Considerations
•

Will offerors be able to prepare a sound technical proposal? Are specific
outcomes clearly stated so that the offeror will know exactly what to do and
know when it is required? Are tasks realistic and performable?

•

Will offerors be able to prepare a sound cost proposal? Is the PWS
sufficiently detailed to enable both the government and the offeror to estimate
labor and other costs and to identify other resources required for
accomplishing each task element?

•

Are standards clearly identified in such a way that all parties can adequately
measure performance? Is the PWS too restrictive?

•

Are proper quantities and delivery dates indicated for each deliverable? Are
schedules and frequencies of performance clearly defined?

•

When it will be necessary to reference other documents, are they properly
described and cited?

•

Have the appropriate government and industry standards been researched
and referenced in the PWS?

•

Have any data requirements been specified separately in a data requirements
section? Have extraneous data requirements been eliminated?

12

INCENTIVES AND REMEDIES
Introduction
Incentives are not unique to performance-based contracting. Contracts, by their very
nature, motivate successful performance—contractors that fail to per form satisfactorily
don’t get paid. And, increasingly, contracts are incorporating specified incentives
designed to encourage superior performance. Beyond that, the government collect,
maintain, and uses information on past performance. An exceptional track record gives
a contractor a greater competitive edge in future source selections and thus a stronger
assurance of future work. Also, contract clauses such as liquidated damages provide a
negative incentive—if the contractor causes harm or damage to the government as a
result of failure to perform, the contractor must compensate the government in
accordance with the contract clause. The overall point is that incentives are an
essential element of PBSA (or any contract) and that several methodologies are
available that are useful for motivating high-quality performance. This section discusses
he use of incentives and remedies.
Types of Incentives
Incentives can be monetary, non-monetary, positive, or negative. They can be based
on cost, on schedule, or on quality of performance. Regardless of the final composition
and structure of the incentives, the goal is to encourage and motivate the best-quality
performance.
Cost-based incentives: Performance incentives are designed to relate profit or fee to
results achieved by the contractor in relation to identified cost-based targets. For
services such as maintenance of equipment, typical measures would be mean time
between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR) or system availability rates (incommission rates). Regardless of the measure, performance incentives must be
quantified and within a reasonable range (high-target-low
Award-fee contract arrangements: Using evaluation factors established in an award
fee plan, award-fee contracts are a tool for subjectively assessing contractor
performance for a given evaluation period. They allow contractors to earn a portion (if
not all) of an award-fee pool established at the beginning of the evaluation period. The
agency unilaterally determines the amount of earned fee. In the context of PBSA, the
award-fee evaluation will be based on a subjective assessment of how well the
contractor meets or exceeds the applicable performance standards.
Award-term contract arrangements: Award-term arrangements are very similar to
award-fee contracts, however, instead of money as compensation for quality
performance, the contractor is awarded additional periods of performance. Or, if
performance is habitually below standard, the period of performance can be shortened.
Award-term arrangements are most suitable when establishing of a long-term

13

relationship is valuable both to the government and to the potential contractor. They
differ from options in that award terms are based on a formal evaluation process and do
not entail the regulatory procedures associated with priced options. Award-term
arrangements are relatively new. See Appendix I for more information.
Schedule incentives: Schedule incentives focus on getting a contractor to exceed
delivery expectations. They can be defined in terms of calendar days or months,
attaining or exceeding milestones, or meeting rapid-response or urgent requirements.
Past performance: Past performance information can affect decisions to exercise
options or to make future contract awards. Thus past performance assessments are a
quick way for motivating improved performance or to reinforce exceptional performance.
Keep in mind that the integrity of a past performance evaluation is essential.
Considerations When Contemplating Incentives
•

Will enhanced performance provide additional value to the mission?

•

Which areas of the requirement would benefit most from enhanced performance?
Which areas do not need added incentives (or which areas can do without than)?

•

How much is the agency willing to pay to achieve a level of performance beyond the
performance standard? Is there a potential for using cost-sharing?

•

Do contractors within the particular industry prefer additional performance periods
(award terms) in lieu of monetary incentives (award fees)?

•

Is the incentive affordable? Will it affect timelines or in a schedules in a positive
way? Adversely?

TIP:

Make sure incentives are realistic and attainable—in other words, understand
hat a contractor will not spend a dime to earn a nickel. To achieve the desired
outcome, i ncentives should be consistent with the effort and the contract value.
They must also be carefully structured to consider their overall impact and to
avoid any unintended consequences while providing value for achieving the
mission.

TIP:

Make sure that incentives are built upon performance objectives and
performance standards, and ensure that they are measurable and attainable. If
hey do not clearly communicate the agency’s desires and expectations, the y will
have—at best—only a random chance of achieving the desired outcome. An “I ll
know it when I see it” approach is neither an incentive nor a performance
standard.

Remedies for Non-Performance
Performance-based contracts should specify procedures or remedies for reductions in
price (or fee) when services are not performed or do not meet contract requirements.

14

Additionally, agencies must give the contractor an opportunity to correct nonconforming
services at no increase in contract price. While reductions in price may be appropriate
for a particular circumstance, it is also recognized that it may be more feasible to require
he contractor to re-perform the service at no additional cost. Acceptance procedures
should provide the appropriate terms to address less-than-satisfactory performance. In
cases where commercial item acquisition procedures are used, agencies should rely on
contractor’ existing quality assurance systems as a substitute for acceptance
procedures. The bottom line is that agencies should not pay for services that do no
conform, do not meet performance standards, or have not been properly rendered.

15

CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Introduction
Traditionally, performance-based contracting methods have used the term “quality
assurance” to refer to the functions performed by the government to determine whether
a contractor has fulfilled the contract obligations pertaining to quality and quantity. The
erm “quality assurance,” however, does not accurately capture the true essence of
performance-based service acquisition, since agencies do not “assure quality”—rather
hey assess contractor performance. As such, performance assessment is no
surveillance. In a performance-based environment, it is the contractor that is
contractually responsible for quality assurance, further motivated through various kinds
of incentives such as award-fee and past performance assessments. Agencies are still
responsible for ensuring that they get what they are paying for – by periodically
evaluating performance through the appropriate assessment methods. Hereafter,
“performance assessment” will be used in place of the term “quality assurance” unless
otherwise noted.
Performance Assessment Plan
A performance assessment plan describes how government personnel will evaluate and
assess contractor performance. It is intended to be a “living” document that should be
revised or modified as circumstances warrant. It is based on the premise that the
contractor, not the government, is responsible for managing and ensuring that quality
controls meet the terms of the contract. If the performance assessment plan is no
incorporated into the contract, it should nevertheless be furnished to the contractor.
Quality Control Plan
A quality control plan is a plan developed by the contractor for its internal use to ensure
hat it performs and delivers high-quality service. Often the quality control plan is part of
he contractor’s original proposal, and in many cases it is incorporated into the resultan
contract.
Assessment Methods
Several methods can be used to evaluate a contractor’s performance. Below are some
examples of commonly used assessment methods:
Random sampling: Random sampling is a statistically based method that assumes
receipt of acceptable performance if a given percentage or number of scheduled
assessments are found to be acceptable. The results of these assessments help
determine the government’s next course of action vis-a-vis the contractor, if necessary,
and whether adjustments in this method of assessment are necessary. If performance is
considered marginal or unsatisfactory, the evaluators should document the discrepancy

or finding and begin corrective action. If performance is satisfactory or exceptional, they
should consider adjusting the sample size or sampling frequency. Random sampling is
he most appropriate method for frequently recurring tasks. It works best when the
number of instances is very large and a statistically valid sample can be obtained.
Periodic Sampling: Periodic sampling is similar to random sampling, but it is planned
at specific intervals or dates. It may be appropriate for tasks that occur infrequently.
Selecting this tool to determine a contractor’s compliance with contract requirements
can be quite effective , and it allows for assessing confidence in the contractor withou
consuming a significant amount of time.
Trend analysis: Trend analysis should be used regularly and continually to assess the
contractor’s ongoing performance over time. It is a good idea to build a database from
data that have been gathered through performance assessment. Additionally,
contractor-managed metrics may provide any added information needed for the
analysis. This database should be created and maintained by government personnel.
Customer feedback: Customer feedback is firsthand information from the actual users
of the service. It should be used to supplement other forms of evaluation and
assessment, and it is especially useful for those areas that do not lend themselves to
he typical forms of assessment. However, customer feedback information should be
used prudently. Sometimes customer feedback is complaint-oriented, likely to be
subjective in nature, and may not always relate to actual requirements of the contract.
Such information requires thorough validation.
Third-party audits: The term “third-party audits” refers to contractor evaluation by a
hird-party organization that is independent of the government and the contractor. All
documentation supplied to, and produced by, the third party should be made available
o both the government and the contractor.
Performance Assessment Plan Developmen
Performance assessment plans should be developed in conjunction with the preparation
of the performance work statement. For every performance objective listed in the
Performance Requirements Analysis, determine one or more methods of performance
assessment. Also make sure that the methods allows for adequate assessment of the
performance standard itself. In other words, will random sampling allow you to
adequately measure performance in relation to the stated performance standard?
The performance assessment plan should outline the acceptance process and should
state how acceptance of services will occur (i.e., DD-250, etc).
Performance assessment plans should describe how performance information is to be
captured and documented so that it can later serve as past performance information.

17

Effective use of the performance assessment plan, in conjunction with the contractor’s
quality control plan, will allow the government to evaluate the contractor’s success in
meeting the specified contract requirements.
Those assessment methods identified in the performance assessment plan, together
with the contractor’s quality control plan, will also help in evaluating the success with
which the contractor delivers the level of performance agreed to in the contract.
Some Considerations for Determining the Appropriate Assessment Method
•

What is the most effective way to assess the contractor’s performance
outcomes in relation to the associated performance standards?

•

How critical is this particular task to the requirement and to the overall
mission? Is performance assessment critical to a particular task, and is it is
worth the government’s time and effort?

•

How long should the assessment period be? How is this linked to the
criticality of the task? How frequently should performance assessment take
place?

•

What is the availability and of assessors (quality assurance evaluators)? Are
here enough evaluators to carry out the degree of evaluation contemplated?

•

do the proposed evaluation methods represent a common commercial
practice for the particular service area?

•

Is re-performance practical or reasonable?

TIP:
Recognize that the methods and degrees of performance
assessment may change over time in proportion to the evaluator’s level of
confidence (high or low) in the contractor’s performance.

•

TIP:
Degrees of performance assessment are typically based upon
difficulty or criticality of a service—the greater the difficulty or criticality, the
more performance assessment may initially be necessary.

SOURCE SELECTION CONSIDERATIONS
Introduction
PBSA source selection procedures do not necessarily differ from source selection
procedures in general or have special considerations. However, there are some key
areas worthy of brief review. The key to successful use of any factor in the source
selection process is the establishment of a clear relationship between the performance
work statement (PWS), Section L of the solicitation (Instructions, Conditions, and
Notices to Offerors or Respondents), and Section M of the solicitation (Evaluation
Factors for Award). The factors that are chosen for evaluation should tie in with the
work requirements.
Best Value
A source selection based on best value is an excellent strategy to follow when using
performance-based contracting methods. One of the goals of PBSA is to achieve the
highest degree of quality and efficiency at a reasonable price. While competition is
critical to attaining these goals, the best-value offeror may not be at the lowest price.
Best-value source selections allow for tradeoffs in evaluation factors that will consider
award to other than the lowest-priced offeror.
One of the main challenges in determining best value is assessing performance risk.
This is challenging because the offerors may be proposing different approaches tha
can be difficult to compare (an “apples to oranges” comparison). While Section M of a
solicitation provides the basis for evaluation, there is no precise science to assessing
dissimilar approaches toward fulfilling a performance-based service requirement. If no
expertise exists, consider enlisting the aid of consultants if possible.
Instructions to Offerors
Section L is that place in the solicitation where information and guidance are provided to
help offerors prepare proposals in response to the solicitation. As previously stated, the
PWS, Section L , and Section M all tie together. The PWS describes the requirement.
Section L requests information relating to how the offeror will execute that requirement,
for evaluation purposes. Section M describes how the proposal will be evaluated for
source selection purposes. The following example describes one piece of a
requirement to illustrate the relationship between the three areas simply.

value, in terms of
echnical merit and cost,
with additional
consideration for the
offeror’s relevant pas
performance (track
record).

Evaluation Factors
Evaluation factors used for assessing offerors’ proposals should be crafted so as to
permit the selection of the offeror that will most likely provide the best value. To help
ensure that selection decisions are based on significant determinants, evaluation factors
should be kept to a minimum. Each factor should receive the appropriate weighting
based on its relative importance. Evaluation factors may include areas such as
management approach, relevant experience, past performance, and price.
Past Performance Information
Past performance information should be an important element of every evaluation and
contract award. The use of past performance as an evaluation factor in the contrac
award process enables agencies to better predict the quality of future work and the
likelihood that the work will be satisfactory. It also gives contractors a powerful
incentive to strive for excellence. Performance factors should be tailored to the key
performance requirement. For example, if one of the performance standards for a callcenter requirement is that the contractor must respond within 2 minutes when
answering specific questions, the performance evaluation can objectively address how
well the contractor met this standard in performing past contracts.
Consider using past performance information from a wide variety of sources both inside
and outside DoD. The DoD Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance
Information (PPI) is a great source for helping understand the importance of PPI in
awarding and administering government contracts. It is a practical reference tool on
DoD past performance policy. It is designed to articulate the key techniques and
practices for collecting and using performance information. You can find the guide a
http://www.acq.osd.mil/ar/#ppiguide for further details on the subject.

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Introduction
Contract administration embraces all those activities performed by government officials
after award to ensure the performance and delivery of requirements within the terms of
he contract. It encompasses all activity involving the government and the contractor
from contract award until performance completion and contract closeout. Contrac
administration constitutes the management of the contract from both a contractual and
echnical standpoint to assure that the contractor delivers in accordance with the
contract’s terms. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the PBSA team to understand some
of the common activities within contract administration and their role in this process.
The specific nature and extent of contract administration varies from contract to
contract. It can range from the minimum acceptance of a delivery and payment for
delivery to extensive involvement by program, audit, and procurement officials
hroughout the contract term. Factors influencing the degree of contract administration
include the nature and complexity of the service and the type of contract.
Good contract administration also assures that the end users are satisfied with the
product or service being obtained under the contract. One way of verifying customer
satisfaction is to obtain input directly from the customers through the use of customer
satisfaction surveys. These surveys help to improve contractor performance because
he feedback can be used to notify the contractor when specified aspects of the contrac
are not being met. Customer satisfaction surveys also help to improve communications
between the procurement, program, and contractor personnel.
Postaward Orientation
The purpose of a postaward orientation is to ensure that the contractor and the
government completely understand their respective roles in the contract arrangemen
and their relationship after award and before contract performance begins . While the
decision to conduct a postaward conference is at the discretion of the contracting
officer, postaward orientations are highly recommended to encourage a strong business
relationship at the onset of the contract.
A postaward orientation allows all interested parties to discuss the contract and the
elements of the requirement. This type of discussion helps the contractor and the
government to achieve a clear and mutual understanding of contract requirements,
erms, and conditions and identify and resolve any potential or current problems.
However, the contractor should already have a strong working knowledge of the
requirement. All issues discussed during the postaward conference should be
documented.

22

Documenting Contractor Performance Assessments
Each performance assessment activity should be documented as it is conducted. This
documentation constitutes an official record and may be considered past performance
information. The people assessing performance should use a checklist to record their
observations of the contractor’s performance. ALL performance should be documented,
whether it is acceptable or unacceptable in accordance with the performance
assessment plan.

Appendix H
Performance Work Statement (PWS) Writing Tips

Sample PWS Format
Support Services Contracts. A PWS for support services will generally describe all the
pertinent work to be performed, along with measurements of adequate work
performance, evaluation and assessment techniques, and applicable incentives. Below
are common elements that are included in a PWS:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Introduction
Scope of Work
Requirements/Performance Standards
Contract Deliverables
Data Requirements
Appendixes

Major Systems Contracts. Contracts for definition and development of major systems
should consist of short, outcome-based PWSs that do not necessarily incorporate the
detail of that of a support-service PWS. These requirements will usually have a
specification/contract deliverable requirements list, which may contain specific produc
requirements as well. Regardless, the PWS should describe all requirements necessary
o complete each task element and should be comprehensive to allow the contractor the
means of generating information necessary for design, prototype, test, and verification
phases of the procurement. Following is a suggested outline:
1. Introduction
2. Scope of Work
3. Work to be Performed
3.1 Program Managemen
3.2 Systems Engineering
3.3 Design and Development of Primary Mission Product or Space Vehicle
3.4 Other Work
3.4.1 Launch Suppor
3.4.2 Performance Assurance
3.4.3 Training
3.4.4 Anomaly Resolution
3.5 Performance Standards
4. Contract Deliverables

37

The PWS goal for major systems acquisition is to acquire the effort in distinct phases,
with each phase encompassing a concrete objective. This approach also helps
safeguard against committing scarce resources to an effort prematurely.
Study and Preliminary Definition Contract. For study and preliminary definition
contracts, the PWS should provide sufficient latitude for creativity, innovation, and
research. Describe desired outcomes in such a way that further study can be made for
he most promising systems. Following is a suggested outline:
1. Introduction
2. Scope of Work
3. Project Schedule
4. Contract Tasks
4.1 Performance Standards

Data Requirements Appendix
Research and Development (R&D) Contracts. R&D efforts often focus on abstrac
objectives where outcomes are difficult to describe precisely in advance. Therefore, an
R&D PWS can be challenging to develop. Consider breaking the effort into “suboutcomes” or phases. The PWS should provide flexibility to allow offerors innovation
and creativity. In basic research, emphasis will normally focus on limited rather than
ultimate objectives. In basic research programs, where results cannot be determined in
advance, no deliverable is required except a final report, and objective performance
standards cannot be set, the proper procurement vehicle is usually a cooperative
agreement rather than a contract. Following is a sample outline:
1. Introduction
2. Scope of Work
3. Description of Tasks to be Performed
3.1. Performance Standards
4. Schedule
5. Reporting Requirements
6. Attachments, Appendixes and Exhibits

38

Typical Sections of the PWS
Introduction. Describes program goals, desired results to be achieved, interfaces tha
must be considered, and any previous problems that have been encountered (e.g., any
known phenomena, techniques, methodology, or results of related work). Keep this
section succinct and to the point.
Scope of Work. This is a summary section that briefly describes the purpose of the
current work and the desired outcome. It should also establish such general
requirements as place of performance, normal work hours, applicability of Service
Contract Act, etc.
Requirements. This portion is basically transference of the Performance Requiremen
Summary (PRS) matrix into the PWS. In other words, it is the PRS in text form, also
containing greater detail. Specify standards to which the requirement must be
completed. Include historical data on previous contracts or work by in-house personnel.
Consider that a contractor will have a greater chance at success with adequate
information that clearly defines the magnitude, quality, and scope of each outcome.
Data Requirements. This section contains information on data requirements, such as
reports or any of those items contained within a contract data reports list (CDRL).
(Some agencies instead list CDRL items separately in Section J of the contract). Strive
o minimize data requirements that require government approval and delivery. Acquire
only the data thaat are absolutely necessary. The usual rule of thumb is to limit data to
hose needed by the government to make a decision or to comply with a higher level
requirement.
Attachments, Appendixes, and Exhibits. Through preliminary research and acquisition
planning, the acquisition team should already have screened potentially relevant and
necessary directives (e.g., the government, DoD, and federal agencies). If only a portion
of a directive is pertinent, do not reference or include it in its entirety. Instead, excerp
only required parts of the directive into the PWS. Consider that the number of directives
referenced should be few and should be restricted to those necessary as sources of
such vital information as task descriptions, quality standards, and statutory or regulatory
limitations.
Many undesirable consequences can result from excessive or inappropriate application
of directives, such as confusion or error due to conflicting guidance or unintentional
direction buried within the document. If the government specifies “how to perform,” even
within the context of one or more published documents, it then assumes outcome
responsibility.
Any essential document referenced in the solicitation should be furnished either with the
solicitation or made available at a specified location noted in the solicitation. Remember
o include the date or version of each document.

39

Schedules or Period of Performance. This PWS section provides a realistic delivery
schedule for contractor performance and completion. Provide sufficient detail for the
contractor to establish specific, detailed milestones against which progress can be
measured.
Task Orders. Task-order contracts will also require well-written, precise, definitive
PWSs that include performance standards and incentives as appropriate. Ensure tha
all essential taskings are included and that those that are unnecessary or duplicative
are deleted. Task descriptions should clearly define each deliverable outcome.
Subtasks should be listed in their appropriate order and should conform to the
numbering within the basic PWS from which the task order derives.

Language Principles Helpful in Writing the PWS
The PWS will be read and interpreted by a variety of personnel from diverse disciplines.
he words must be understood not only by the drafters but also by the readers.
Moreover, offerors interested in proposing will interpret words within the PWS to identify
potential costs to determine anticipated profit and ability to compete with other offerors.
Therefore, define and express each requirement in a clear, concise, correct, and
complete manner.
Style. This is the method used in expressing ideas in phrases, sentences, and
paragraphs. Strive to include all the essential information in a concise, accurate,
horough, and logical sequence, with the clearest, simplest possible presentation. Avoid
he use of complex words. The purpose of writing is to express, not impress.
Sentences. Good writing of any type depends on natural order. It is wise to eliminate a
long, complicated sentence by rearranging it into two or three shorter, simpler
sentences limited to a single thought or idea. Avoid spicing sentences with legal
phrases, technical jargon, and other elaborate phrases. This type of writing is difficult to
read and comprehend. Strive to omit extraneous words or phrases—eliminate
unnecessary words from sentences and omit unnecessary sentences from paragraphs.
Paragraphs. A paragraph may consist of one or more sentences to state and discuss a
single idea or like ideas. State the main idea in the first or topic sentence at the
beginning of the paragraph to allow readers to grasp the meaning immediately. The
opic sentence provides a base for subsequent sentences in developing and supporting
he main idea. While paragraph length will vary, avoid long paragraphs if possible,
since they may crowd ideas and confuse the reader. Shorter paragraphs usually are
more visually appealing and easier to read and understand.
Language Use. Use the active voice rather than the passive. Active writing uses action
verbs that illustrate the subject as performing rather than receiving the action verb. The
active voice is nearly always clearer and more direct than the passive, resulting in fewer
words without reducing clarity of technical and contractual intent. Also, the active voice
makes the subject (i.e., the contractor) responsible and accountable for the action or
performance required. The active voice is tailor-made for the performance-based
contracting world. Examples of active versus passive voice use (for routine services)
include:
Active: Clean up all debris at the end of each workday.
Passive: The debris shall be picked up at the end of each workday.
Active: Empty trash containers twice a week.
Passive: Trash containers shall be emptied twice a week.
Active: Install new air filters in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations.
Passive: New air filters are required in accordance with the manufacturer’s
recommendations.

41

Ambiguity. Ambiguity is the use of vague, indefinite, uncertain terms and words with
double meanings. Examples of some ambiguous phrases include “securely mounted,”
“properly assembled,” and “carefully performed.” They are ambiguous because one
can’t quantify, precisely measure, or state objectively what these phrases mean.
Punctuation. Use minimal punctuation to keep the PWS clear. Since the goal is to write
simple, short, concise sentences, a well-written document should require minimum
punctuation. When complicated punctuation is required, consider rewriting the sentence
instead. Construct sentences so that inadvertent misplacement or elimination of a
punctuation mark will not alter the intended meaning. Moreover, for maximum possible
clarity, follow the formal rules of punctuation.
Abbreviations/Acronyms. Abbreviations/acronyms are a form of shorthand used to
make complex terms short and precise. However, many misunderstandings arise from
using them because of reader unfamiliarity or because the y may have multiple
meanings (e.g., “CO” could mean commanding officer, contracting officer, or change
order, depending on the context in which it appears). Remember to define them upon
first use, followed by the abbreviation/acronym in parentheses. When there are many
abbreviations/acronyms, develop a glossary of them.
Symbols. Recommend using the full word associated with the symbol unless the
meaning is universally clear (e.g., foot for ‘, inch for”, pound for #, at for @, percent for
%).
Numbers. Spell out numbers under 10 except when they represent dimensions. Use
he numeral form for figures 10 and above (e.g., 12, 45, 88). Represent dimensions,
degrees of temperature, percentages, and dollars and cents as numerals (e.g., 2 inches
by 4 inches, 40 degrees F., 30 percent, $6.75). “One” or “zero” should always be
spelled out when used alone. When two numbers are used together to define both size
and quantity, use a written word for one number (e.g., six 55-gallon metal drums; eigh
40-Cu. Yd. non-compactor containers)· Using both words and numerals (e.g., “ten (10)
calendar days”) is allowable but is usually superfluous.
Redundancy and Repetition. Avoid redundancy and unnecessary repetition. They
reduce clarity and increase the likelihood of ambiguity, inconsistency, and internal
contradiciton.
Misused Words and Phrases. Here is a list of often-misused and abused words,
phrases, and terminology that, when they are improperly applied, will only confuse the
reader and obfuscate rather than clarify what the government’s true requirements are:
1. Use of shall and will.· Shall is used to specify that a provision is binding, and i
ordinarily is used to describe the work required to be done by the contractor. Will, on
he other hand, is used simply to express a statement of acts and actions that will occur
(simply futurity).

42

2. Use of any and either. These words imply a choice in what needs to be done
contractually. Unless the intent is to give the contractor a choice, specify the true intent.
For instance, the word any means a limited number selected at the discretion of the
reader (contractor). The statement, “mow any areas over....” can mean any of the areas
selected by the contractor, while “mow areas over..” means every area spelled out in
he requirements. The word either implies a choice between two options. For instance,
“clean glass on either side” is incorrect if the intent is to require the contractor to clean
both sides of the glass.
3. Use of and, or, and/or, and etc. Use and if both conditions are true, and or if only one
of the conditions is true. Avoid using and/or, because using those two words together
creates ambiguity. That is, they may be intended to indicate that both conditions are
rue or that only one is true, and it is unknown which of the two cases is intended. Avoid
he use of etc. because the reader may not be aware of what constitutes of the subse
of etc.

Appendix I
Award Terms

SAMPLE OF AN AWARD-TERM PLAN
1.0 INTRODUCTION
This is the basis for evaluating of the contractor’s performance and for presenting an
assessment of that performance to the term-determining official (TDO). The evaluation
for the number of term points to be awarded will begin at the start of the contract.
Award-term contracting is effective when
• performance metrics are objective,
• a long-term business relationship is of value to the government and to the
contractor, and
• the expected outcomes are known up-front.
The specific criteria and procedures used for assessing the contractor’s performance
and for determining the award term earned are described herein. All TDO decisions
regarding the award-term points—including, but not limited to, the number of points, if
any; the methodology used to calculate the points; the calculation of the points; the
contractor’s entitlement to the points: and the nature and success of the contractor’s
performance—are final and not subject to dispute.
The award term will be provided to the supplier through unilateral contract modifications
based upon points earned as determined by the TDO.
2.0

ORGANIZATION

The award-term organization includes the TDO and an Award-Term Review Board
(ATRB) consisting of a chairperson, the contracting officer, a recorder, other functional
area participants, advisory members, and the performance monitors.
3.0 RESPONSIBILITIES
a. Term-Determining Official. The TDO approves the award-term plan and any
significant changes to it. The TDO reviews the recommendations of the ATRB,
considers all pertinent data, and determines the earned award-term points for each
evaluation period. The TDO appoints the ATRB chairperson.
b. Award-Term Review Board Chairperson. The ATRB chairperson chairs the
meetings of the ATRB and appoints the non-mandatory members of the board and the
performance monitors. The ATRB chairperson briefs the TDO on recommended earned
erm amounts and the contractor’s overall performance and recommends award-term
44

plan changes to the TDO.
c. Award-Term Review Board. ATRB members review performance monitors’
evaluation of the contractor’s performance, consider all information from pertinen
sources, prepare interim performance reports, and arrive at the earned award-term
points recommendation to be presented to the TDO. The ATRB will also recommend
changes to this plan. An assessment of the contractor’s performance will be done on a
yearly basis.
d. ATRB Recorder. The ATRB recorder is responsible for coordinating the
administrative actions required by the performance monitors, the ATRB, and the TDO.
e. Contracting Officer (CO). The CO is the liaison between contractor and
government personnel. Subsequent to the TDO decision, the CO evaluates the awardterm points available and modifies the contract period of performance, if necessary, to
reflect the decision.
f. Performance Monitors. Performance monitors maintain written records of the
contractor’s performance in their assigned evaluation areas so that a fair and accurate
evaluation is obtained. Monitors prepare interim and end-of-period evaluation reports as
directed by the ATRB.
4.0 AWARD-TERM PROCESSES
a. Available Award-Term Points. The earned award-term points will be based on the
contractor’s performance during each evaluation period. An accumulation of positive
points (e.g., +50, +75, or +100) is required for a one-year term extension, while an
accumulation of negative points (e.g., -50, -75, or -100) results in a one-year reduction
in the contract period. It is important that the point system be tailored to the particular
acquisition.
b. Evaluation Criteria. If the CO does not give specific notice in writing to the contractor
of any change to the evaluation criteria prior to the start of a new evaluation period, then
he same criteria listed for the preceding period will be used in the following award-term
evaluation period. Modifications to the plan shall take effect in the next evaluation
period.
c. Interim Evaluation Process. Interim evaluations will be conducted at least every six
months. At the discretion of the TDO, interim evaluations may take place more
frequently (e.g., at major milestones). The ATRB recorder notifies ATRB members and
performance monitors 14 calendar days before the midpoint of the evaluation period.
Performance monitors submit their evaluation reports to the ATRB 21 calendar days
after this notification. The ATRB determines the interim evaluation results and notifies
he contractor of the strengths and weaknesses for the current evaluation period. The
CO may also issue letters at any other time when it is deemed necessary to highligh
areas of government concern.

45

d. End-of-Period Evaluations. The ATRB recorder notifies ATRB members and
performance monitors 14 calendar days before the end of the evaluation period. The
contractor presents its self-assessment to the CO within five working days after the end
of the evaluation period. This written assessment of the contractor’s performance
hroughout the evaluation period may also contain any information that could be
reasonably expected to assist the ATRB in evaluating its performance. The selfassessment may not exceed 25 pages. Performance monitors submit their evaluation
reports to the ATRB 14 calendar days after the end of the evaluation period. The ATRB
forwards copies to the contractor. The performance monitors provide oral presentations
o the ATRB 21 days after the end of evaluation period. The contractor is then given an
opportunity to address the performance monitor evaluations. The ATRB prepares its
evaluation report and recommendation regarding earned or unearned award-term
points. The ATRB briefs the evaluation report, and recommendation to the TDO within
30 calendar days after the end of the evaluation period. The TDO determines the overall
award-term points for the evaluation period within 45 calendar days after each
evaluation period. The TDO letter informs the contractor of the earned award-term
points and the total cumulative points. Upon the accumulation of sufficient award termpoints, the CO issues a contract modification within 15 calendar days after the TDO’s
decision is made authorizing an award extension or reduction based on the earned or
unearned award-term points.
5.0 AWARD-TERM PLAN CHANGE PROCEDURE
Proposed changes to the award-term plan will be bilateral. If either party desires a
change to the award-term plan and a mutual agreement cannot be reached, the original
award-term plan will remain in effect.

46

AWARD-TERM CLAUSE
In addition to the terms set forth elsewhere in the contract, the contractor may earn an
extension or reduction to the contract period from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10
years on the basis of performance during the evaluation periods. The contractor is
evaluated during the first year of performance, but extensions or reductions start in the
second year. If scores are very good during Year 2, the contractor earns Year 4; if
scores are very good in Year 3, the contractor earns Year 5. In Year 5, the contractor
must earn a score of “excellent” in order for the contract period to be extended beyond
Year 5. Consistent scores of “excellent” during succeeding years earn contract period
extensions up to a maximum of 10 years.
The contract period may also be reduced on the basis of the contractor’s performance
against the stated performance parameters. Points are awarded or deducted during
each year of the contract on the basis of how the contractor has performed against the
predetermined criteria. The contract period is then extended or reduced to reflect this
assessment.
(a) Award Term. The award-term concept is an incentive that permits extension
of the contract period beyond the base period of performance for superior performance
or reduction of the contract period of performance because of poor performance.
(b) Term Points. Positive or negative points are accumulated during each
evaluation period on the basis of the contractor’s performance. An accumulation of
positive points (e.g., +50, +75, or +100) is required for a one-year term extension, and
an accumulation of negative points (e.g., -50, -75, or -100) results in a one-year
reduction in the contract period.
(c) Monitoring of Performance. The contractor’s performance will be continually
monitored by the performance monitors whose findings are reported to the ATRB. The
ATRB recommends an award term to the TDO, who makes the final decision on the
award-term amount on the basis of the contractor’s performance during the award-term
evaluation period.
(d) Award-Term Plan. The evaluation criteria, the associated points, and the
associated award-term extensions or reductions are specified in the award-term plan.
(e) Modification of Award-Term Plan. Changes may be made to the award-term
plan at any time during contract performance, provided that both parties agree to them.
If agreement cannot be reached on changes, the initial award-term plan remains in
effect.
(f) Self-Evaluation. The contractor will submit to the CO, within 5 working days
after the end of each award-term evaluation period, a brief written self-evaluation of its

47

performance for that period. This self-evaluation shall be limited to 25 pages. It will be
used in the ATRB’s evaluation of the contractor’s performance during this period.
(g) Disputes. Decisions regarding the award term, including—but not limited to—
he amount of the award term, if any; the methodology used to calculate the award term;
calculation of the award term; the supplier’s entitlement to the award term; and the
nature and success of the contractor’s performance, are made by the TDO. These
decisions are final and are not subject to dispute.
(h) Award-Term Extension. The contract period may be modified to reflect the
TDO decision. The total contract ordering period, including extensions under this
clause, will not exceed 10 years. The award-term provision must be included in the
solicitation and resulting contract. If at any time the contract period does not extend
more than two years from the TDO decision, the operation of the award-term provision
will cease and the ordering period will not extend beyond the term set at that time.
