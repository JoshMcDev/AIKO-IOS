Executive Summary
A Services Acquisition Workshop (SAW) is a facilitated workshop built around a specific acquisition and
its multi-functional integrated project team (IPT). The workshop walks the complete team through the
performance-based acquisition (PBA) process from beginning to end. This white paper provides
background information on SAWs, details key findings from observational research into the Defense
Acquisition University (DAU) SAW facilitation process, and outlines recommendations for implementing
SAWs for civilian agencies; specifically to:

Develop a certified cohort of Civilian SAW (CSAW) facilitators
Establish a centralized CSAW Program Management Office
Create a CSAW facilitator toolkit of resources and materials
Leverage and/or enhance existing technology to support CSAWs
Measure CSAW performance and return on investmen

Background
SAWs have been used by Department of Defense (DoD) components for more than ten years to mentor
and guide integrated project teams (IPTs)1 in developing their acquisition planning, market research,
performance requirements, request for proposal, source selection, contractor performance assessmen
planning and execution documents.2 The goal of the SAW is not to finalize or even complete drafts of
any particular documentation, but rather to get the team to collaboratively work through the steps and
initialize documentation to the point that the IPT feels comfortable completing the documentation on
heir own.
While the SAW is primarily focused on facilitating dialogue and collaborative teamwork among IPT
members, the role of the SAW facilitator is also that of an instructor, to the degree that he/she must be
able to provide high-level training on the steps of Performance Based Acquisition (PBA) and the various
ools available to the team, such as DAU’s Acquisition Requirements Roadmap Tool (ARRT). ARRT is
actually a collection of tools that help IPTs to create elements of
heir acquisition documents by guiding users through a structured
process. As users work through the tool, they have the ability to
generate work products in MS Word format for further editing.3
Although DoD components are the primary users of SAWs, many
civilian agencies have recognized the benefit of conducting SAWs for
heir projects as well. DAU’s certified SAW facilitators have been
providing increasing numbers of SAWs over the last several years. In

T​ he ​ARRT Suite​ is available for download, but it may not work on some government computers or may require IT Admin support to install DoD PKI/PKE
Certificates. GSA’s Acquisition Gateway Team is partnering with DoD to develop a version of ARRT on the ​Acquisition Gateway​, though it is still in the early
stages of development.

WHITE PAPER - CSAW
2018, DAU set aside 20 slots throughout the year for SAWs, with priority given to DoD components. For
2019, DAU has increased the number of available slots to 75 and, as of the writing of this paper, has
already filled at least 20 slots. Of the SAWs conducted in 2018, approximately 20% were done for
non-DoD agencies. By policy, DAU must provide SAW facilitation first to DoD components, such that, if a
civilian agency reserves a slot, they may be bumped for a DoD component that needs the slot.
In December 2012, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) issued a ​memorandum
mandating the use of SAWs or equivalent for DoD components with service acquisition requirements
over $1 billion before an acquisition strategy could be approved. This mandate was later incorporated
into ​DoD Instruction 5000.74​ (January 2016). In 2017, another DPAP ​memorandum​ lowered the dollar
hreshold from $1 billion to $500 million.

DAU provides SAWs organized around the three acquisition life cycle phases (planning, development
and execution) consisting of seven (7) steps as described in ​Chapter 10 of the Defense Acquisition
Guidebook​ (​see​ ​Figure 1​), which correspond to the steps outlined in the ​Steps to Performance Based
Acquisition (SPBA)​ application4 (​see Figure 2​).

First conceived of in the early 2000s in discussions between acquisition leadership in the Department of Commerce and the Office of Federal
Procurement Policy, The ​Steps to Performance Based Acquisition​ is web-based knowledge management tool that connects the web of PBA information
ogether in one place. The application is the product of multi-agency collaboration and was originally known as Seven Steps to Performance Based
Acquisition or 7 Steps.

WHITE PAPER - CSAW
Figure 2: Steps to Performance Based Acquisition

DAU tailors the SAW based on documentation provided by the IPT for their specific services acquisition
hrough the SAW intake process. Certified DAU facilitators deliver the SAW and often draw upon
additional expertise across the DAU faculty representing other career fields and functional areas.5
DAU has a cadre of certified SAW facilitators in accordance with ​DoDI 5000.74 Enclosure 5, Part 5.d
(p.24)​. The instruction does not specify the requirements for certification; however, DAU has established
a certification process for the faculty they use to deliver SAWs (see ​Section 4.1​).
The Civilian SAW (CSAW) initiative was proposed by a member of the the Professional Services
Interagency Team who had experienced the benefits of the approach. As a result, General Services
Administration (GSA) in partnership with Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) began research
into CSAWs, hosting a webinar and publishing an ​article​ on the topic in the Acquisition Gateway. In FY
2018, GSA aimed to expand the practices more widely in civilian agencies by developing agency
facilitators and a capability for support from GSA. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP)
advocated the initiative to support the increased scaling of new and flexible acquisition practices across
government and the initiative was included in the Professional Services government wide category
management plan. As a part of that effort, GSA was tasked with researching and observing DAU’s
approach to delivering SAWs, document findings, and providing recommendations for the
implementation of civilian services acquisition workshops.

DAU SAW Facilitation Research
3.1.

Research Methodology
In order to better understand how DAU manages SAWs and identify how best to implemen
CSAWs, GSA sent a representative to observe DAU’s Services Acquisition Workshop Train the
Trainer session for Army, a facilitated SAW for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and a
facilitated SAW for the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC). The GSA representative
observed the sessions, spoke with DAU faculty, engaged with participants, gathered relevan
session materials, and documented observations and information relevant to implementing

CSAWs. The information gathered during these observations has led to several key findings upon
which the recommendations in this paper are based.

3.2.

DAU’s SAW Train the Trainer
DAU has established a certification process under their DAU Directive 7196, where the Deans of
heir regions and two colleges have approval authority to certify SAW facilitators. DAU has
worked with the Army to develop a pipeline of certified facilitators within Army. As a part of tha
effort, DAU provides a Train the Trainer (TTT) course for prospective Army SAW facilitators. This
course provides an overview of performance based acquisition (PBA), the SAW body of
knowledge, facilitation basics, lessons learned / best practices from SAWs, current acquisition
policy, and basic elements of the ARRT Suite. The four-day course has several participan
prerequisites, including:
●
●
●
●

CLC013 Performance Based Services Acquisition​ (​3 hours online)​
ACQ165 Defense Acquisition of Services​ (​8 hours online)​
ACQ255 Services Acquisition Management Tools​ (​>18 hours online​)
ACQ265 Mission-Focused Services Acquisition ​(​28 hours classroom)​

Additionally, DAU assumes that participants are being sent by their respective organizations
because they have shown potential acumen for both facilitation and training. The prerequisite
courses provide much greater depth of knowledge in the areas of PBA, defense acquisition
policy, and acquisition tools such as the ARRT Suite. The TTT provides high-level refreshers on
he same topics and ties all the pieces together with an emphasis on the SAW body of
knowledge and facilitation practices.
Early on in the TTT, DAU provides participants with access to a folder of resources including
presentation decks, templates, tools and other aids that the prospective facilitators may find
beneficial to use or to share during workshops.

A SAW is a consulting engagement – each requirement is unique and requires
detailed preparation to be successful
DAU conducts a “Step 0” (​see A
​ ttachment A)​ assessment to collect a baseline
status of the project and documentation
The facilitator(s) should start working with the Project Manager/ Contracting
Officer (PM/CO7) well before the SAW to develop a logical plan of execution
It is advisable to have two facilitators for the workshop, one with functional
subject matter expertise related to the requirement and the other with
performance based acquisition expertise
A common set of resources for facilitators helps bring some degree of
standardization and consistency to otherwise uniquely tailored workshops - in

addition to DAU’s resources, there are a number of additional resources that
GSA and its cohort partners could add to the mix
Facilitation competency is fundamental for SAWs - this is a specialized skill set,
not simply training acumen, and can greatly influence workshop outcomes
The facilitator(s) can be greater assets to the team by being independent (no
vested in the outcome) and an outsider (offering a different perspective)
DAU’s certification requires candidate training, observation,
co-facilitation/coaching (​see ​Attachment B​), and culminates in a review of the
candidates knowledge and skills prior to issuing a certificate

DAU SAW Facilitated Sessions
GSA observed two SAWs for two different agencies conducted by two different SAW facilitator
eams. One SAW was for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the other was for the
Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC). Each workshop was unique due to the specific
needs, challenges, and timelines of the respective organizations. As such, each workshop was
facilitated differently, partially due to differences in facilitation styles and partially due to unique
needs of the team and the individual tailoring of the workshop to meet those needs.
While the workshops were conducted in two very different approaches, there were
commonalities and each workshop appeared to result in positive outcomes for the team. One
commonality was that on Day 1 the facilitators walk the team through an overview of the steps,
providing the team with a common understanding of the process and a shared vocabulary
around which to discuss their unique requirements. This first-day training component was done
from DAU SAW facilitation slide decks that are a part of SAW Facilitator resources. It should be
noted that in both SAWs, the facilitators gathered pain points, challenges, and specific needs of
he team and tailored the decks to support the team throughout the remainder of the week
(adding topical slides or removing slides or including additional detail as needed).
Getting the team to engage with each other around each step (or at least around those steps of
most relevance to the team) is the primary objective of the facilitator. The facilitator is not there
o provide a solution or direction to the team. It can be particularly valuable for the facilitator to
offer different perspectives for consideration, encourage the team to consider alternative
approaches supported by acquisition regulation and policy that may be beneficial, and ask
probing questions to engage the team in critical thinking about their requirements. Equally
important, is for the facilitator to know when to pull back and let the team run and occasionally
spin their wheels. As an outsider being empowered by the sponsoring organization, the
facilitator is also a potentially valuable resource to the team for overcoming barriers or
constraints in their ability to ask organizational decision-makers or leaders to attend and help
he team to present concepts or ideas to them or even ask them difficult questions when
necessary.
Every facilitator will have inherently different strengths that they will leverage to support the
workshop, so techniques will vary. However, certain best practices, tools and techniques for
facilitation are critical to successful workshop outcomes. Simple practices such as conducting

introductions, setting ground rules, and reviewing the agenda make a significant difference in
how quickly and productively the team engages with each other.
Regardless of the custom tailoring of the workshop and the varying approaches to facilitation,
eam members who participate all seemed to walk away with positive reactions to the process.
Each participant is asked to complete an evaluation of the SAW on the last day of the workshop
(​see A
​ ttachment C)​ .
3.3.1.

Insights on the ARRT Suite
DAU’s ARRT is downloadable from the Services Acquisition Mall (SAM). The tools are
robust MS Access databases that guide users through a structured process to develop
performance-based requirements statements, which may be used to generate outputs
such as a Performance Work Statement (PWS), a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
(QASP), and Performance Requirements Summary (PRS). Additionally, the suite of tools
may support users working on developing evaluation criteria, independent governmen
cost estimates and inputs for Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System
(CPARS).
The ARRT Suite was developed for use on DoD computers by DoD users. Recognizing the
value of the tool, DAU made the Suite available to non-DoD users. However, ARRT does
not always work on non-DoD computers and many instructors have their own copy tha
hey take with them because the current downloadable version does not always work.
ARRT also requires some degree of training to use efficiently and is most effectively used
when an experienced user can guide a new user through the process.
Recently, DoD revoked ARRT’s Certificate of Networthiness and DAU no longer provides
echnical support for the tool. For this reason some DAU facilitators do not use the ARRT
as a part of their workshops.
An effort is currently underway to develop a web-based version of ARRT on the
Acquisition Gateway that focuses on ease of use. DoD has provided funding to GSA’s
Gateway Team and initial research and planning for the Agile8 development of this new
ool is underway.

Effective facilitation skills helps the team generate momentum and engage
earlier in the workshop
Knowledge of the federal acquisition environment and to a degree, the
functional area of the team’s requirement, helps facilitators guide the team to
consider additional angles and approaches they may overlook

Team members may be unfamiliar with existing tools and resources that could
support their work - facilitators can help by being familiar with existing
acquisition tools and introducing these to the team
The ARRT Suite can be a helpful aide to the team - though it is not critical to the
outcome of the workshop

CSAW Implementation Recommendations
4.1.

Develop a Certified Cohort of CSAW Facilitators
SAW facilitation requires three major competencies:
●
●

●

Facilitation​ - demonstrated ability to lead groups to consensus decisions using best
practices and techniques in facilitation
Instruction ​- demonstrated ability to deliver effective training and coaching on the
subject of performance based acquisitions, current federal acquisition environment, and
various acquisition tools and resources
Consultation ​- demonstrated ability to quickly develop an understanding of an
organization's unique challenges and needs and provide tailored guidance as
appropriate

DAU has already established a relatively simple, though not easy, process for becoming a
certified facilitator. This process includes several online courses and one to two classroom
courses (including their Train the Trainer session), observation of multiple workshops done by
an experienced facilitation team, and co-facilitating multiple workshops with an experienced,
certified facilitator. Upon completion of these steps, the candidate’s knowledge and skills are
reviewed by DAU faculty before a certificate is issued.

Recommendation 1-1: ​GSA, in partnership with OFPP, should establish a CSAW
Facilitation Certification.
4.1.1.

Near-Term CSAW Certification Elements

●
●

One or both of these courses:
ACQ255 Services Acquisition Management Tools​ (​>18 hours online​)
ACQ265 Mission-Focused Services Acquisition ​(​28 hours classroom)​

●
●
●
●

And all of the following:
CLC013 Performance Based Services Acquisition​ (​3 hours online)​
GSA/OMB provided Facilitation Training​ (~​32 hours classroom​)
CSAW Facilitator Train the Trainer​ (​~24 hours classroom)​
Observation of at least 2 SAWs or CSAWs​ (​~64 hours of observation)​

The governmentwide Professional Services Category has established a cohort of
potential CSAW facilitators who have completed ACQ265 and will likely participate in
he GSA/OMB provided Facilitation Training in FY19. Completion of the above elements
may be sufficient to issue an interim certification.

10

GSA Federal Acquisition Service
Office of Professional Services & Human Capital Categories

WHITE PAPER - CSAW
4.1.2.

Mid-Term CSAW Certification Elements

●

Same requirements as for the near-term and add:
Co-Facilitation of at least 2 SAWs or CSAWs​ (​~64 hours of facilitation​)

After the initial cohort of facilitators is active, future facilitator candidates should follow
he same certification requirements with the addition of co-facilitating with a certified
lead facilitator. The lead facilitator should observe the candidate and provide a written
evaluation using a form similar to that used by DAU (​see Attachment B)​ . This element is
recommended as an addition for the mid-term (sometime in the next 1-2 years) as it will
require:
a. a cadre of experienced CSAW Facilitators who are capable of co-facilitating and
providing constructive feedback and evaluation of prospective candidates, and
b. establishing a process through which to match up candidates and evaluators
and a process for documenting feedback will take some time.
4.1.3.

Long-Term CSAW Certification Elements
●

●
●
●
●
●
●

All courses to be offered through FAITAS registration:
Customized non-DoD Mission-Focused Services Acquisition course ​(​classroom
or online)​ - tailored to emphasize the array of current acquisition tools available
o support IPT members through their process
Customized non-DoD Performance Based Services Acquisition​ course (​online​)
Customized Facilitation Training course​ (​classroom)​
CSAW Facilitator Train the Trainer workshop​ (​classroom or possibly online)​
Observation of at least 2 SAWs or CSAWs​ (​~64 hours of observation)​
Co-Facilitation of at least 2 SAWs or CSAWs​ (​~64 hours of observation​)
Certification Application Submission​, including:
○ Course completion certificates
○ Documentation of observed workshops
○ Co-facilitator feedback forms
○ Agency/supervisor endorsemen

In the long-term (3-5 years), repackaging the DoD-policy heavy courses into more
general courses for civilian agencies could make them more digestible and relevant to
he civilian application of SAWs. Further exploration and research into formal
certification should be done by a multi-agency sub-team.

Recommendation 1-2: ​Form an interagency sub-team on CSAW certification.
An interagency sub-team should be formed with representatives from GSA, OFPP and possibly
FAI to do further research into developing a formal certification. The team should explore using

11
Back to Top

GSA Federal Acquisition Service
Office of Professional Services & Human Capital Categories

WHITE PAPER - CSAW
a model similar to what DAU uses for their certification while establishing a process that could
be coordinated online in the long-term.
Demand for SAWs is growing and it will take some time to develop a robust certification process
and have it vetted and approved through the appropriate channels.

Recommendation 1-3: ​Develop a CSAW Facilitator Train the Trainer course​.
A CSAW Facilitator Train the Trainer course should be developed as a learning capstone for all
aspiring facilitators to tie all of the elements together. This would provide candidates with
access to CSAW resources, offer an opportunity to practice facilitating with feedback, and
provide assistance getting on a schedule of observations and co-facilitations.

4.2.

Establish a Centralized CSAW Program Management Office
DAU’s success in delivering SAWs to over 225 teams in the last five years has been supported by
many aspects of DAU’s mission to “Provide a global learning environment to develop qualified
acquisition, requirements and contingency professionals…” and DAU’s existing infrastructure.

Recommendation 2-1: ​Establish a Civilian SAW Program Management Office.
A Civilian SAW Program Management Office (PMO) should be established. The PMO would serve
multiple functions including:
●
●
●
●
●

●

Serve as a single entry point for CSAW requests
Establish standardized processes for intake and workshop preparation
Maintain and update the body of knowledge contained in SPBA and provided through
he CSAW Train the Trainer
Create and manage a schedule of CSAWs and matching facilitators to the requirements
Provide support for CSAW Facilitator Certification by matching candidates with
co-facilitators, and potentially establishing or being the review body for certification
applications
Establish, review and refine measures of CSAW effectiveness and ROI

While many cohort members may go on to deliver CSAWs within their organizations on an
ad-hoc basis, the demand for CSAW facilitators is likely to outgrow a single individual as the
value is realized. Demand for CSAWs is also likely to grow from agencies that do not have the
capability in-house to facilitate. Furthermore, based on DAU’s experience, there is almost always
an advantage to the workshop if the facilitators are independent of the organization and can
bring an outside perspective. This creates a need for program management support capable of
coordinating intake, responding to increasing demand, and scheduling CSAWs across the
network.
A CSAW PMO, with the ability to distribute work across a growing network of certified
facilitators, would streamline the intake process and balance the workload among the available
facilitators. For CSAWs to achieve the same success that DAU has had with DoD components,
12

Office of Professional Services & Human Capital Categories

WHITE PAPER - CSAW
here will need to be sufficient administrative and management support. Establishing a CSAW
PMO will also be important (if not absolutely necessary) if CSAWs are to be provided a
reimbursable service.

Recommendation 2-2: ​Develop and implement a centralized intake process for CSAWs.
With or without the establishment of a PMO to support CSAWs, appropriate preparation understanding the customer’s requirement, bringing appropriate functional expertise, and
delivering an effective workshop tailored to the specific needs of the project team - is crucial to
successful outcomes for the customer. Creating a standard intake process to collect certain
baseline information about the project requirement provides the foundational elements tha
facilitators will need to begin their research, engagement and workshop preparation ahead of
he CSAW.

4.3.

Create a CSAW Facilitator Toolkit of Resources and Materials
The resources that DAU provides to their SAW facilitators are extremely valuable and should be
adapted for CSAWs. Many of their resources would need to be revised to remove DoD specific
policies, shift the focus from DoD’s 7 Steps to PBA to the current SPBA application and to replace
DAU branding.

Recommendation 3-1: ​Revise and re-package the existing repository of DAU’s SAW
support materials for the CSAW initiative​.

Recommendation 3-2: ​Collect additional resources from the CSAW cohort.
Recommendation 3-3: ​Curate and regularly update the repository of resources that is
ultimately created.
4.4.

Leverage and/or Enhance Existing Technology to Support CSAWs
Technology support for CSAWs is three pronged:
1. A web-based platform for potential CSAW customer to find information, get an
understanding of the process and easily request a workshop
2. A web-based repository of CSAW Facilitator resources that can be accessed from any
location with an internet connection
3. A web-based guide and resource repository that supports team members
post-workshop such as the SBPA application

Recommendation 4-1: ​Create a simple website for general information about the
Civilian SAW Program.
This informational site would provide interested users with information on CSAWs; what they
are, how the process works, the potential benefits, etc. The website could potentially also
support the initial request and intake process.

Recommendation 4-2: ​House the repository of resources for CSAW facilitators online.
Facilitators are likely to encounter facilities with limitations on connecting devices or removable
media, but generally still have access to the Internet. By creating an online repository of CSAW
resource, facilitators could then access and share resources with CSAW teams from any
web-enabled location. There may still be a benefit to loading the repository of resources on
removable media (e.g. CDs, USB Drives, etc.) though many government networks do not allow
USB Drives to be plugged into their connected hardware.

Recommendation 4-3: ​Regularly review and update SPBA application content to reflect
changes in the federal acquisition environment and add new case studies and lessons
learned as more CSAWs are conducted.
SPBA guides users through the steps covered during the CSAW. It can serve as a robus
ake-a-way for workshop participants and includes links to additional tools and resources, as

well as providing a resource library of PBA specific samples, examples, templates and guidance.
As CSAW facilitators conduct more workshops and see the needs and pain points of various
organizations, their ability to contribute valuable insights to the SPBA content will increase the
overall value of SPBA to users. They should be regularly involved in reviewing and updating
application content.

Recommendation 4-4: ​CSAW PMO (if established) should have a stakeholder interest in
he development of ARRT on the Gateway.12
Recommendation 4-5: ​CSAW and DAU facilitators should be extensively involved in user
esting of the ARRT on the Gateway.
4.5.

Measure CSAW Performance and Return on Investment
How do we know if a workshop results in better outcomes than would have been achieved
without one? This may be one of the most challenging questions facing CSAWs, though if
successfully answered, may be one of the most beneficial to the long-term success of the
program.

Recommendation 5-1: ​Form a sub-team to further research and establish baseline
performance indicators for CSAWs.
Specific effort should be given on how to assess the return on investment (ROI) of workshops.
This team should collaborate with DAU so that ROI might be measured for all workshops being
conducted across government.

Recommendation 5-2:​ Collect feedback and evaluation from all workshop participants.
CSAW facilitators should provide feedback and evaluation forms to all workshop participants
hat collect data on participants’ perception of the workshop’s value. Data from these forms,
and any other sources that may be identified, should be pulled together in a database where i
can be analyzed both at the workshop level and in aggregate. It is recommended that simple,
follow-up questionnaires be sent out to workshop participants at 6 months, 1 year and 18
months.
Example follow-up questions:
●
●
●

12

Where are you at in the acquisition process now?
What decisions, directions or outcomes were arrived at during the SAW that you
might not have otherwise reached?
Is there anything that could have been done (from a facilitation standpoint) to have
added more value or otherwise improved the session?

PSHC, as the organizational owner of SPBA, has requested to be a stakeholder for the application and is awaiting engagement by the Gateway Team.

Was the facilitated SAW a worthwhile investment of your time? If so, why? If not, why
not?

Data collected from participants may help to identify opportunities for workshop improvement.
If effective KPIs are created that can show ROI, that would demonstrate value to prospective
customers and may support future policy decisions regarding the use of CSAWs for non-DoD
acquisitions.

Overall, name actively participated in the identified steps as well as assisted in facilitating
discussions with the participants. In steps 2 and 5, name walked the participants through the
slides; however his lack of knowledge of the program due to late involvement did not allow him to
lead discussions outside of the slide information. Those discussions and tie-in to the customer
program were led by lead facilitator, resulting in a tag team approach for those particular efforts.
Two key areas of success for a SAW, based on DAU experience, is complete familiarity and
knowledge of the ARRT both in terms of navigating inside the tool as well as the benefits of using
he tool – how it allows for the hierarchy in the objectives as well as the linkage to additional
documents such as the QASP and PRS. The second area is the pre-event research and customer
relationship building that occurs in the weeks and months prior to the event. Familiarity with the
program, its challenges, its prior acquisition history as well as researching similar programs for
best practices provides the inherent knowledge and credibility that result in superior impact and
successful outcomes for the customer. Name will need to focus on these two areas to successfully
lead and actively participate in future SAW events.
A final area of consideration for Name is the development/refinement of facilitation skills. As a
workshop facilitator, listening and redirecting skills are more critical than teaching or talking skills.
Asking thought provoking questions with follow up questions pushes the SAW participants to hold
frank, candid and meaningful discussions among the team members who will be executing the
program. This approach helps the participants develop their team relationships and voice
concerns and/or alternatives. It is more important that the team members hear each other than
hear the facilitators. A more beneficial event can be realized when the facilitators listen, restate,
question or redirect as needed in order to keep the participant communication meaningful and on
rack.
Thank you,
Facilitator

● The workshop guides the team through the seven-step service acquisition process from
step one, team formation to step seven, performance management following award of a
contract.
● SAW utilizes the requirements roadmap process for developing performance based
requirements. A SAW involves several interactive exercises in which the team develops
key documents to support their service acquisition such as their team charter, projec
plan, PWS structure, QASP, business strategy and performance assessmen
methodology.
● This SAW will devote significant time to requirements and the acquisition strategy,
based on customer needs.
