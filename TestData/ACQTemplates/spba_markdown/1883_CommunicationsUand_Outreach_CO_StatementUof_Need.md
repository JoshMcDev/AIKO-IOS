appropriately represent the work, the staff, and the products found here. It should
have the look and feel of a visit to the Center, so that visitors to the website come
away with the impression that they have seen the Center, met the staff, and
understand the work.

information such as organization charts, charters, and other inherently governmental
data that is not to be released on the external site. No contractor information is to be
placed on the intranet site.
o The internal website is for the employees to use on a daily basis. It is not to be
viewable outside the Center and thus may contain EAA information, calendar of
events, cafeteria menu, and other contractor and government information that will
assist employees with their daily tasks. This site can also be used to suppor
individual project needs such as the outreach program, the work managemen
requirements, timesheet links, and database support for procurement and publications

II. Performance Management Agreement
Communication:
Project communication consists of both formal and informal settings using varying venues in
order to ensure effective communication between TSSC and USGS project management staff.
Formal communications are denoted in the following bulleted list. In addition, the project’s
management team interacts informally on a daily basis in response to unforeseen requirements
and requests and produces ad-hoc reports as required.
o
o
o
o

Weekly status updates
Monthly performance reports
Quarterly accomplishments reports
Additional meetings and reports as requested.

Evaluation:
Standard performance expectations for contractor support include:
o Providing task assignments on time
o Preparing and distributing deliverables on schedule
o Attending meetings as scheduled
o Preparing communiqués as needed in a timely manner
o Providing quality documents to work sponsors as needed
o Staying within the projected budget and spending plan
For TSSC evaluation purposes the TSSC staff in support of this SON will be evaluated, as
appropriate, against the ten performance criteria in the TSSC contract with the USGS:
o

o

o

o
o

Work Performance. Overall work performance includes customer satisfaction, quality of
deliverables, cost, adherence to USGS guidelines accuracy of delivered information and
imeliness. In addition, contributions of innovation are considered.
Cost Data. Cost management is critical due to the limited budget available. The
contractor is expected to contain actual costs within the budget allocated. Cos
management is also demonstrated by cost saving initiatives, innovative solutions, budge
planning, and budget accountability. Communication of budget issues is highly valued.
Work Management: Work management practices that recognize and enable the USGS
and TSSC to work jointly to identify problems and potential solutions for all involved, and
implements accordingly. Use of appropriate project management practices in the planning
and execution of major projects. TSSC’s ability to include and address the required
deliverables from all USGS areas is critical element.
Staffing: The contractor shall assign the right staff resources to the right projects at the
right time. Innovative and flexible approaches to staffing the work are desirable.
Contract Administration: Not evaluated.

Science Excellence: Not evaluated.
Engineering Processes: Not evaluated.
Communication: The work sponsor will provide changes in required dates, scope of
activity, and needed changes in concept as soon as need for change occurs. Expected
delays in completion of deliverables or a change in the level of effort must be
communicated to the work sponsor as soon as the delay or change is known. The TSSC
is expected to communicate to the work sponsor any change in the level of effort. Verbal
highlights and updates in the full C&O meetings are expected, plus ongoing, event-driven
communication and meetings as needed to communicate across the USGS and TSSC.
Ability to identify potential conflicts of skill and schedule and to negotiate appropriate
solutions is highly valued.
Quality and Process Improvement: Products developed will be of high quality and
complete in scope.
Flexibility: The ability to respond to higher priority tasks immediately. Maintaining
cognizance of a total work environment and on-going activities at EROS is essential to
maintain this flexibility. This means having staff on hand to be flexible.

Change Summary:
Content of this SON will be updated as aspects of the work agreement between the USGS and
TSSC continue to be refined.

“HELPFUL HINTS” from the Seven Steps Interagency Team:
1. This document was not intended as a “performance work statement,” but it does
lay out the tasks that would have to be performed under a communications and
outreach requirement.
2. There are no performance standards stated, although the document does express
what things would be evaluated. In order to make this a true PBA, there has to be a
performance management and measurement plan.
