1.0 BACKGROUND
The 2002 President’s Management Agenda and Public Law 106-107, the Federal Financial
Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, called for deployment of the Grants.gov system.
The President’s Management Agenda (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf),
which provided the mission for Grants.gov, called for agencies to “allow applicants for Federal
grants to apply for, and ultimately manage, grant funds online through a common web site,
simplifying grants management and eliminating redundancies.” Public Law 106-107 called for the
establishment of "a common system, including electronic processes, wherein a non-Federal entity
can apply for, manage, and report on the use of funding from multiple financial assistance
programs...” Grants.gov was successfully launched in 2003 and provides a one-stop electronic
portal where potential grant recipients can find and apply for Federal grant opportunities. The
program is supported by all 26 of the major Federal grant-making agencies, with The Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) as the managing partner. The Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) has developed this Performance-based Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
pursuant to the requirements of the Performance-based Work Statement to obtain system integration
services for the Grants.gov program. The DHHS Program Management Office (PMO) will direc
he efforts of the systems integrator contractor and monitor and evaluate their performance.
2.0. PURPOSE
2.1. This QASP sets forth procedures and guidelines that the DHHS PMO will use in evaluating the
echnical performance of the contractor. A copy of this plan will be furnished to the contractor so
hat the contractor will be aware of the methods that the Government will employ in evaluating
performance on this contract and address any concerns that the contractor may have prior to
initiating work. The Surveillance/Evaluation Methods identified in this QASP, in concert with the
contractor’s Quality Control Procedures (QCP), will assure the Government of satisfactory
contractor performance.
The QASP is intended to accomplish the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials,
Define the types of work to be performed with required end results,
Describe the evaluation methods that will be employed by the Government in assessing the
contractor’s performance,
Provide copies of the quality assurance monitoring forms that will be used by the
Government in documenting and evaluating the contractor’s performance, and
Describe the process of performance documentation.

2.2. The QASP is a tool for use in Government administration of the task order and remains subject
o revisions at any time by the Government throughout the contract performance period. Through
coordination with the contracting office, the DHHS will retain the right to change the surveillance
methods, metrics and Quality Assurance (QA) procedures described in the plan, or to increase or
decrease the degree of surveillance efforts at any time necessary to assure contract compliance. The

2

1406-04-06-TO-61761
DHHS will work in cooperation with the contractor and provide them with an informational copy of
he QASP to enable the contractor to enhance its Quality Control Procedures (QCP).
2.3. The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control
actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure
contract standards are achieved.
2.4. For the purpose of this document, the acronym QAP refers to either Quality Assurance
Personnel or Quality Assurance Person, depending on its context in the sentence.
3.0. ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
3.1. Contracting Officer (CO)
3.1.1. The CO is the only individual authorized to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts
and make related determination and findings.
3.1.2. The CO is the only individual that is authorized to delegate (delegation must be in writing)
specific contract administration duties to other individuals.
3.1.3. The CO ensures oversight and control of contracting actions. S/he will also be responsible for
he day-today monitoring of the contractor’s performance in the areas of contract compliance,
contract administration, cost control and property control; reviewing of the QAP’s assessment of the
contractor’s performance; and resolving all differences between the QAP’s version and contractor’s
version. The CO may call upon the expertise of other Government individuals as required. The
CO’s procurement authorities include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

FINAL authority for any decisions which produces an increase or decrease in the scope of
he contract,
FINAL authority for any actions subject to the “Changes” clause,
FINAL authority for any decision to be rendered under the “Disputes” clause,
FINAL authority to approve the contractor’s invoices for payment, subject to the Limitation
of Costs clause and the Limitation of Funds clause,
Signatory authority for the issuance of all modifications to the contract.

3.2. Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP)— Includes Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE),
Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), and Quality Assurance Specialis
(QAS) personnel –
3.2.1. QAP shall be familiar with contract terms and conditions.
3.2.2. QAP will request additional training, if needed, from the CO.
3.2.3. QAP will monitor the contractor’s performance in accordance with this QASP, evaluate the
contractor’s performance and report the results in a monthly report, citing contractor deficiencies and

3

1406-04-06-TO-61761
providing specific details of each deficiency cited. QAP will note and document acceptable and
unacceptable performance.
3.2.4. QAP shall maintain a surveillance folder/binder containing a copy of this QASP, along with
surveillance forms/reports, contract documents, and correspondence.
3.2.5. QAP shall submit surveillance reports to the CO for review.
3.2.6. It is extremely important for the QAP to establish and maintain a team-oriented line of
communication with the contractor’s Project Manager (PM) and the PM’s staff in order to perform
her/his monitoring functions. The QAP, CO and PM must work together as a team to ensure tha
required work is accomplished in an efficient and proper manner. Performance meetings will be
held on a regular basis in order to resolve serious problems.
4.3. Contractor
4.3.1. The contractor shall control the quality of supplies or services.
4.3.2. The contractor shall tender to the Government for acceptance only those supplies or services
hat conform to contract requirements.
4.3.3. The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system or program for the control of
quality that is acceptable to the Government.
4.0. SURVEILLANCE PROCEDURES
4.1. Performing Surveillance. Actual surveillance must be done as stated in this QASP.
Surveillance includes scheduling, observing, documenting, and resolving performance issues
discovered through surveillance. Even though the Government, through its QAP, will be monitoring
he contractor’s performance on a continuing basis, the volume of tasks performed by the contractor
makes technical inspections of every task and step impractical. Accordingly, only some tasks will
contain incentives/disincentives, as monitored and evaluated as specified in the Performance
Requirements Summary.
4.1.1. Scheduling Surveillance. The QAP assigned to this contract is responsible for developing a
monthly schedule of surveillance activities based on the QASP’s requirements. The schedule should
be completed not later than 7 calendar days before the beginning of the period it covers. The QAP
must give one copy of the schedule to the contract administrator before start of the surveillance
period. Computer-generated or locally devised forms may be used.
4.1.2. Surveillance Approach. The Government’s surveillance approach will be an oversight and
insight approach to evaluating the performance requirements as set forth in the Performance-based
Work Statement. Definitions of each approach and the conditions under which each will be used are
described in the following paragraphs:

4

1406-04-06-TO-61761
•

Insight as an assurance process uses performance requirements and performance metrics to
ensure process capability, product quality and delivery and end-item effectiveness. Insigh
relies on gathering a minimum set of product or process data that provide adequate visibility
into the integrity of the product or process. The data may be acquired from contractor
records/reports, usually in a non-intrusive parallel method.

•

Oversight as applied to this task will result in higher levels of Government surveillance. The
Government will gather information pertaining to the contractor’s process through on-site
involvement in and/or inspection of the process and will monitor the process itself. The
Government’s involvement in the contractor’s performance, through oversight, is determined
necessary by the COTR and client representative.

4.1.3. Documenting Surveillance.
4.1.3.1. Documentation is required to record, evaluate, and report contractor’s performance. This
documentation provides the CO with contractor status as it applies to the performance criteria.
Every effort should be made to make this report to the CO as accurate as possible. The QAP is
required to maintain accurate records of the contractor’s performance. Documenting surveillance is
of major importance to the total process of surveillance. The CO cannot properly administer the
contract without documentation of actual surveillance.
4.1.3.2. All documentation resulting from surveillance must be made part of the contract file. The
QAP must keep the documentation files during the surveillance period, but either monthly or at the
conclusion of the contract, as directed by the CO, the QAP must give the files to the CO for
inclusion in the official contract file.
4.1.3.3. Surveillance Folder. A surveillance folder must be developed and maintained by QAP who
are assigned to accomplish QA for a performance requirement. The folder is typically contained in a
hardcopy, but may be maintained in a computer database provided there is adequate back up of the
data to preclude accidental loss. The surveillance folder must contain as a minimum, the following
documents and be set up using the QAP File Index (Atch 1).
4.1.3.3.1. Appointments. QAP nomination letters and copy of the CO’s Letter to the Contractor
appointing the QAP’s to the contract.
4.1.3.3.2. Contract Documents. The Contract with all modifications, directive documents
references, pertinent terms defined by the contract, equipment listings, SOW and QASP.
4.1.3.3.3. Special Reports Documentation. Minutes of the monthly performance meetings tha
are held with the QAP, CO and the contractor to instill good communication and resolve issues
before they become significant challenges.
4.1.3.3.4. Monthly Inspection Paperwork. Documented surveillance inspections performed by the
QAP will be kept in this section. All paperwork that supports the documented surveillance should
be kept in this section as well. The types of information that may be included are details of
inspections or data gathering, conversations or meetings with the contractor, notes and comments

5

1406-04-06-TO-61761
hat support the inspection paperwork. QAP Monthly Surveillance Reports will be kept in this
section.
4.1.3.3.5. Unacceptable Performance Documentation. A section used for filing all documentation
associated with contract quality assurance, e.g., Customer Complaints (both active and resolved),
notices of contract deficiencies (MFRs of phone conversations, email messages, etc..), the CO’s
inputs/determinations, Cure Notices, Show Cause, and all supporting documentation.
4.1.3.3.6. Final Acceptance and Funding Issues. In this area, keep paperwork for future changes to
he contract, i.e. addendums, options, etc that must be worked during the life of the contract.
4.1.3.4. Monthly Performance Meetings. The QAP, Contractor (or representative), and CO (or CA
if applicable to this contract) will meet monthly at Monthly Performance Meetings to discuss
contract performance, resolve issues, discuss customer complaints, and provide positive interaction
and feedback to all parties. The QAP will provide a list of any unresolved deficiencies to the
contractor's quality assurance representative to afford him/her the opportunity to show where the
problem is already in the process of being worked. If evidence is shown where the contractor’s
quality program has already documented the deficiency and timely corrective action is working the
problem, the QAP will follow up with the contractor’s quality control representative to ensure the
deficiencies are remedied in a timely manner, in accordance with the SOW. All deficiencies
associated with performance requirements listed on the Performance Requirements Summary,
whether remedied by the contractor or not, will be included in the QAP’s Monthly Report regardless
of who identified the deficiency. The QAP will provide a copy of the meeting minutes to all
attendees within 5 workdays of the meeting. The Monthly Performance Meetings will occur
between the time the contractor submits the monthly Status Reports and its invoice.
5.0. SURVEILLANCE METHODS
5.1. Periodic Surveillance. Performance evaluation will be accomplished by monitoring
compliance with the performance requirements as described in the task order and in the
following section of this QASP. The method of evaluation will depend on the service type, and
each service type may be assessed by more than one method. The following are the specific
evaluation methods to be used on the Grants.gov task order:
•

Periodic Inspection - Evaluates tasks selected on other than a 100% or random basis. It may
be appropriate for tasks that occur infrequently and where 100% inspection is neither
required nor practicable.

•

Independent Verification and validation (IV&V)—This method is verification and
validation performed by an individual or organization that is technically, managerially, and
financially independent of the development organization and is used to determine that the
work product delivered by the contractor matches the content requirement in the contract.
This can include various types of system tests, analysis or other V&V techniques.

•

Operational monitoring—Examination of reports generated by automated tools and logs and
websites.

6

1406-04-06-TO-61761
•

Customer feedback—Surveys and random sampling will be used to evaluate customer
satisfaction.

The mapping of specific surveillance methods to performance requirements are provided below.
The method of surveillance is a function of the activities being monitored and associated
performance measures.
5.1.1. Once a month or as required by the performance requirement (frequency will be
dependent on the specific performance requirement), the QAP will review documentation and/or
observe accomplishment of Performance Requirement(s) to ensure the minimum Performance
Standard(s) has (have) been met for the respective Performance Requirement(s).
5.1.2. The QAP must document each surveillance as it is conducted. All performance must be
documented, whether it is acceptable or unacceptable. The QAP will provide the monthly QAP
Assurance Monitoring Report to the CO prior to the Monthly Performance Meetings with the CO
and contractor.
