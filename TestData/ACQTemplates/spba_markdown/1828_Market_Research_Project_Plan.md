[Project Name]
Market Research Plan
Objectives: Conduct market research to determine:
1) the extent to which commercial sources and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts
(GWACs) can possibly fulfill [Agency] (ACRONYM) Project Name and related
requirements;
2) if prices and rates under the current ACRONYM contract with [company name]
(including its option renewal periods) are still fair and reasonable;
3) if new laws, regulations, security conditions, business processes, or other factors
necessitate immediate changes in ACRONYM’s service requirements;
4) whether industry trends, market conditions and business issues suggest changes in
acquisition approach;
5) if opportunities exist to “unbundle” requirements to enable more contracts or
subcontracts to small, small disadvantaged and other socio-economic procuremen
categories;
6) best practices that can be adopted by ACRONYM, and
7) the timeframes for any new procurement actions, including the time needed for a possible
ransition from the incumbent contractor to a new contractor.

HELPFUL HINTS:
Pursuant to FAR Part 10, larger, more complex acquisitions may need a
project plan for market research. While market research is required for all
acquisitions over the simplified acquisition threshold, the level of
documentation and actual research should be commensurate with the size of
he acquisition.
