I. Background and Purpose
The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) seeks to acquire an
upgrade to the capabilities of its current high­end operational computer system in
1998. The desired new system (the Class VIII system) will replace the current NCEP
supercomputer and will function as the centerpiece of the computing and
communications system used for predictive environmental modeling within the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Class VIII system will
be used at NCEP to assimilate the data which are the foundation for operational
environmental modeling and to execute the numerical models which form the basis
for all routine environmental forecasts, public and private, produced in the United
States.
The need to upgrade the NCEP supercomputer is identified in the current NOAA
Strategic Plan and is essential to achieve NOAA's strategic goal to "Advance Short­
Term Warnings and Forecast Services". This upgrade is also critical to the attainmen
of the NOAA strategic goal to "Implement Seasonal to Interannual Climate
Forecasts". Many specific environmental modeling and forecast goals for the years
1999 through 2003, as identified in the current NOAA Operational IT Plan, are
dependent upon the timely acquisition of the Class VIII system.
Within the National Weather Service (NWS) the NCEP Class VIII system is one of the
echnology components of the Modernization and Associated Restructuring program.
This program was designed to apply modern technology to environmental
forecasting problems and to streamline the NWS forecast process and is described in
he Strategic Plan for the Modernization and Associated Restructuring of the National
Weather Service.
The role of the Class VIII system is more fully described in a number of NCEP
documents. One of these is the current NCEP Information Technology Plan,

Project Agreement

Requirements Analysis number NA­W­WD­95­01, which describes organization­
wide plans for computing at NCEP.
In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring a Class VIII system in 1998, NCEP will
utilize the Department of Commerce's re­engineered acquisition process termed
CONOPS. That process is described in a document entitled Department of
Commerce Acquisition Process Case for Change. The intent of the new process is to
create an improved acquisition environment which will benefit both the vendor
community and the Government. In order to successfully implement this new process
he Government seeks the cooperation of the vendor community in an effort to
conduct business in an atmosphere of integrity, openness, and fairness.
This Project Agreement establishes an agreement between the Class VIII Acquisition
Team (the project team) and the senior management of the National Weather
Service. The agreement empowers the project team to research, acquire, deploy,
and monitor the systems and services that comprise the Class VIII system. The
Project Agreement outlines the objectives of the project, project team duties, budge
availability, and the high­level milestones for the accomplishment of these projec
objectives.

II. Authority
This project is hereby authorized by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Weather
Services and the Director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. It is
identified as a requirement of NCEP, the organization tasked with operating state­of­
he­art computer systems to execute prediction models in support of the Nation's
environmental forecasting program.
The Class VIII acquisition undertaken by this project will require a Delegation of
Procurement Authority from the Department of Commerce, Office of Budget,
Management and Information.

III. Project Objective
The project team will secure a Class VIII computing system for the National Centers
for Environmental Prediction. This system must be operational prior to March, 1999
when the support contract for the current system ends. The new system will be
installed in Building 28 at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
NCEP has in the past replaced its high­end systems on a five­year cycle. One of the
objectives of this project is to more effectively maintain currency in the rapidly
evolving technology which comprises such systems. As demonstrated in the NCEP
Class VIII High­Performance Computer Acquisition Cost/Benefit Analysis, it is
possible to increase the overall computing capacity of NCEP supercomputer systems
and to do so with improved cost effectiveness by reducing the replacement cycle for
hese systems to three years. Accordingly, it is anticipated that a system intended to
replace the system acquired through this project will be procured three years after
he Class VIII is accepted.
Another method by which the project team will help to ensure that the Class VIII
system efficiently delivers as much computational capacity as possible is to evaluate
its performance annually. The annual review process will include a consideration of
how to best achieve graduated performance goals via mid­life system enhancements
intended to foster continued cost effective operations.
The field of Numerical Weather Prediction is scientifically exciting today as the
accuracy of environmental forecast models approaches levels undreamed of ten
years ago. Higher resolution models with improved physics will enable the NWS to
produce forecasts with better spatial resolution and valid at longer time scales than
ever before. These expanded models are computationally demanding and require
very robust capabilities in order to execute within a fixed time window of shor
duration. Therefore, the primary project objective is to secure the maximum level of
performance possible within the constraints of the budget. The minimum acceptable

Project Agreement

performance is a system that is at least five times faster than the current NCEP high­
end system.
The NCEP Class VIII system is more than simply a high­speed computer. It includes
additional hardware (storage devices, communications interfaces, and other
peripherals), software (primarily, but not limited to, the operating system and
compilers), full system maintenance, and support services. This system comprises
he core computational resource for the Numerical Weather Prediction efforts of the
National Weather Service. This operational system provides essential governmental
services and, therefore, a second key objective of the project team is to obtain a
system with a very high level of reliability and availability.

IV. Approach
This project will follow the general approach and guidelines established during the
CONOPS pilot studies conducted in 1996 and 1997. This will speed the exchange of
information, help assure equal opportunity for all respondents and encourage
openness by making as much information as possible available simultaneously to all
parties. It is intended to meet the Government's need for computing capabilities by
contracting with the private sector. This process makes use of market research to
help determine an acquisition strategy and to refine the Government's requirements
in relation to the capabilities and approaches of the private sector.
To promote an equitable and active dialog with all members of private industry who
may be interested in responding to the stated needs of the Government, electronic
communications will be used extensively throughout this solicitation process. This
will speed the exchange of information and help assure equal opportunity for all
respondents, and is intended to encourage openness by making as much
information as possible available simultaneously to all parties. This Projec
Agreement and the solicitation documents that result from the work of the projec
eam will be posted publicly on the Internet.

V. Members
The Class VIII Acquisition Team consists of a core group which provides the steering
and decision­making authority for the project. This group is augmented by associates
and consultants from several parts of the Department of Commerce. The team is
headed by a project team leader who has overall authority and responsibility for the
successful accomplishment of the project objective and fulfillment of the terms of this
Project Agreement. The selection and assignment of other team members has been
made on the basis of cross­functional needs and includes a warranted procuremen
official, a procurement specialist, program representatives, an information technology
analyst, a budget analyst, a legal representative, and project advisors.

VI. Empowerment and Management Review
The project team is hereby authorized to take all steps necessary for the acquisition
of the NCEP Class VIII computer system, including related hardware, software, and
support services. Subject to the Delegation of Procurement Authority as noted in
Section II, the project team has complete acquisition authority and source selection
authority. No authorizations other than those already obtained or described in this
agreement will be required. This is critical in order to maintain the aggressive
schedule necessary for this acquisition.
The project team is empowered to conduct any acquisitions necessary to support the
Class VIII procurement. This includes complete authority to conduct micro purchases,
purchase card acquisitions, and contracting by other methods, within the budgetary
limits and within the project scope described in the Project Agreement. All contracts
will be executed by a warranted Contracting Officer who is a member of the projec
eam.

Project Agreement

The project team will fulfill its responsibilities with respect to management oversight
by conducting briefings immediately prior to the following actions:
1. release of solicitation and statement of need,
2. award decision,
3. system acceptance,
4. system fully operational.
In addition to the project team conducting briefings for management prior to the
actions noted above, briefings on the status of the acquisition process will be
provided by the project team leader more frequently, e.g. approximately monthly. The
briefings will include a review of project milestones, an update of the state of the
budget supporting the Class VIII system, and an assessment of the status of the goals
and objectives of the project. The briefings will also provide a forum to raise and
address other issues which the project team feels might be of interest to those
providing management oversight. Finally, the briefings will afford managers the
opportunity to raise questions or topics which they believe the project team should
address.
It is the intent of the parties to this Project Agreement that except under unusual
circumstances no additional reviews or documentation will be required. The projec
eam includes oversight advisors who will participate throughout the acquisition
process and that on­going interaction will serve in lieu of reviews and clearances by
he Office of Acquisition Management, the Office of Budget and Managemen
Information, NOAA, and the NWS.
The following planning documents form the basis for the activities of this project and
hey will be provided publicly:
NOAA Strategic Plan;
NOAA Operational IT Plan;
Strategic Plan for the Modernization and Associated Restructuring of the
National Weather Service;
NCEP Information Technology Plan, NA­W­WD­95­01; and
NCEP Class VIII High­Performance Computer Acquisition (Cost/Benefi
Analysis).
The following documents will also be provided publicly by the project team during the
course of this acquisition:
Project Agreemen
Solicitation, including Statement of Need
While protecting vendor confidentiality, management will have complete access to
he Internet facilities maintained by the project team. In addition, management will be
granted access upon request to procurement sensitive documents maintained on a
secure intranet. The Internet and intranet facilities together will contain the mos
recent drafts of all pertinent documents. The project team will inform management of
significant deviations from the acquisition milestones that may affect the planned
award date (March, 1998) or the date by which the system will become fully
operational (February, 1999).

VII. Estimated Value
The total value of the Class VIII Acquisition project is estimated to be $35,800,000.
This represents a planning level approved by NOAA and the Department of
Commerce, but not yet approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Funding
is planned over a four­year period covering fiscal years 1999 through 2002 and will
be provided through the appropriation process annually, subject to the availability of
funds. This level of funding is intended to acquire an appropriate computer system,

VIII. Milestones
The overarching goal of this project is to take all steps necessary to provide for the
imely acquisition and continued availability of the NCEP Class VIII system, including
related hardware, software, and support services. To ensure that the capabilities of
his system will be available when needed, the project team plans to award the Class
VIII contract in March, 1998. This contract will call for the subsequent installation of a
system in July, 1998. Acceptance of that system is scheduled to occur in October,
1998, after which time the operational use of the system will begin.

operation for a successor system.

X. Performance Goals and Measures
This project activity has clearly defined performance requirements as well as fiscal
and temporal constraints. The project team intends to acquire the bes
supercomputer system available for the budgeted level of funding and to do so in a
way that accommodates the termination of the use of the current supercomputer in
February, 1999. Maintaining the acquisition schedule described herein, which is
designed to support the withdrawal of the current system from operations at the
completion of the existing contract, while at the same time providing adequate
computational resources is the highest priority for the project team.
In order to meet NCEP's performance requirements, the computational capacity of
proposed Class VIII systems will be measured by carefully reviewing demonstrated
performance on a suite of NCEP benchmark programs. Once the Class VIII system is
installed and operational, the project team will ensure the continuing acceptability of
he Class VIII system and verify that its utilization supports all pertinent operational
schedules and appropriate scientific goals.
Performance monitoring during the life of the system will be continuous. System
availability of not less than 96 per cent has been the historical goal for high­end
systems at NCEP and this system will meet or exceed that requirement.
During the life of the Class VIII system, the project team will conduct annual reviews
of the system in order to consider its performance and to evaluate opportunities for
extending its capabilities. System upgrades must be available within the initial
budget constraints of this acquisition and the review process which will result in
decisions on how best to enhance overall performance will begin within one year of
system acceptance.
The Class VIII system must offer sufficient capacity to support the necessary activities
of the Environmental Modeling Center and other legitimate user groups in addition to
he execution of operational numerical models and other mission­critical
applications.
The following table, submitted as a portion of the 1997 NOAA Operational IT Plan,
summarizes some pertinent operational performance measures. Those for fiscal
years 1999 and beyond are explicitly dependent upon the timely acquisition of the
Class VIII system and so are most appropriate for this Project Agreement.

The shaded entries here are those directly dependent upon the availability of the
computational capacity and performance of the Class VIII system.
The statistics used to measure performance in the table above require some
explanation. In the case of the hurricane prediction system, 24­hour position
accuracy refers to the difference between the actual and 24­hour forecast positions of
he centers of hurricanes or other tropical storms as measured in kilometers. The
https://www.acquisition.gov/seven_steps/library/agreement2.html

table shows that the amount of error for such forecasts should be less than 130
kilometers in the year 2000.
Quantitative precipitation forecasting is one of the most demanding forecas
problems routinely addressed by the NWS. The accuracy of such forecasts is
measured using skill scores for the occurrence of precipitation which exceeds a
particular threshold value. In the case of both the mesoscale prediction system and
he short­range ensemble forecasting system, the table reflects a measure of forecas
skill against a threshold value of one inch. The skill score is a statistic derived by
comparing forecast and observed areas for the event of interest, here the occurrence
of greater than one inch of precipitation. A perfect forecast would yield a skill score of
1.00, whereas a forecast that is completely erroneous would result in a skill score of
0.00. The figures in the table for the mesoscale prediction system and the short­
range ensemble forecasting system indicate an expectation of an increase in
forecast skill of about 25 per cent between 1997 and 2000.
The indicated performance measure for the global prediction system is the mean
difference between the actual and 24­hour forecast of wind velocity at approximately
34,000 feet above the surface of the earth as measured in meters per second. The
able shows that the average world­wide error of such forecasts should be not higher
han 6.0 meters per second in 1999.
The final measure in the table relates the performance of the coupled model to the
occurrence of El Nino­Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. This is a subtle forecas
problem and the measure of the degree to which these events can be successfully
predicted is accordingly complex. ENSO events are typically measured by the
magnitude of the departure from climatological norms for sea surface temperatures
within a given index area in the equatorial Pacific ocean. The official index area tha
NCEP uses to define El Nino occurrences and within which it measures forecast skill
is the region from 120 to 170 degrees west longitude and between 5 degrees north
and 5 degrees south latitude. This region is known as Nino3.4. The indicated
performance measure for the coupled ENSO model is the correlation of the Nino3.4
sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) comparing current observations with
forecasts made 6­month prior to those occurrences, as averaged over a 5­year
period. The table indicates the skill for El Nino forecasts with a 6­month lead time for
he period from 1997 to 2001 should reach 0.75. That amounts to approximately a 15
per cent increase in the level of skill of the coupled model according to this statistical
measure.
