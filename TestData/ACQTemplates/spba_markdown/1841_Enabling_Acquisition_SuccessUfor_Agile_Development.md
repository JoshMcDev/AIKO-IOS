T

o federal leaders concerned that their next information technology (IT) project will
suffer the fate of recent and well-documented technology failures, the concept of
agile development holds great promise. Recognizing the philosophy’s potential to
significantly improve the outcomes of IT projects and bring them in on schedule and within cost, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has urged agencies to favor agile
development over the “grand design” approach of traditional waterfall development.1
But what exactly is agile development? How does it differ from traditional software
development methodologies, and how can you enable its success through the acquisition process? This Advisory begins to explore these and other questions related to the
implementation of agile development within the federal government. We start with an
introduction to the agile philosophy and the elements of the agile development life cycle
before looking at acquisition strategies that enable its success. This foundation will increase your understanding of agile development and position you to support its implementation at your organization.

What is agile development and how is it different from
raditional methods?
Agile refers to a philosophy for developing software through iterative “bursts” of effort, where all members of an acquisition team work together to deliver functionality
hroughout the project as opposed to all at once (and usually at the end). By delivering working software incrementally, agile takes an empirical approach by using lessons
learned and input from users and stakeholders to determine the pace and performance
of the project team. Agile is not, as shown in the chart on page 2, based on prescriptive
specifications that attempt to predict the requirements of an IT product or service in total
and before starting work. However, while agile has the capacity to change plans and incorporate learning, it is not completely unstructured.
The traditional waterfall methodology of software development is a sequential and
linear process where requirements gathered in a preaward environment strictly govern
contractor performance in the postaward environment. It is characterized by a long planning process resulting in highly detailed specifications and stringent work plans that dictate all facets of the development cycle. Once completed, the product is delivered to end
users in one “big bang” deployment. Where agile uses an evidence-based or empirical
approach, waterfall requires significant front-end planning, detailed (and often inflexible)
requirements documentation, strict project planning, and limited input from end users
or customers. And where agile delivers working software continuously throughout the
development life cycle, waterfall provides software at the end of the development period
in an all-or-none delivery.

Advisory
What are the benefits of using the agile
development philosophy?
The benefits of agile development have the potential
o far exceed those of traditional waterfall while providing a more manageable risk environment. Today, fewer
resources are required to develop and test new software,
and data analysis makes it possible to determine in nearreal time whether it works. Errors can be fixed in hours
with relatively little interruption to end users, allowing organizations to constantly upgrade their IT environment by
adding new features to existing software on a perpetual
basis.
Given these trends, OMB has encouraged agencies
o adopt agile principles by breaking large requirements
into smaller modules, to deliver functional, useful software throughout the period of performance. This makes
good business sense given Moore’s Law, which observes
hat computing power doubles approximately every 18
months.2 The benefits of agile development (outlined in the
chart at right) are consistent with the principles of modular
contracting as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) part 39 and are a focal point of this Advisory.

As an acquisition professional, what do I
need to understand about agile?
First, understand that agile is neither a methodology
nor a specific set of processes. While it is informed by
principles and guidelines, agile development is more of a
philosophy, and its implementation is dependent on the
experience and talent level of its practitioners. Therefore,
acquisition professionals need not be expert in all things
agile. Simply understanding a few fundamental aspects
will enable you to support an agile procurement while providing a foundation from which you can build mastery of
he technical nuances of this discipline through continued
experience.
Second, it is important to understand the key values of
his philosophy, as described in “The Agile Manifesto.”3
Agile development values:
• Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
• Working software over comprehensive documentation
• Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
• Responding to change over following a plan
While agile values the attributes on the left over those
on the right, it does not advocate a complete abandonment of tools, documentation, negotiation, and planning.
Rather, the values of agile development are informative for
he philosophy and its application to the dynamic nature of
oday’s IT environment.

What do these values mean for the
acquisition professional?
Valuing individuals and interactions over processes and
ools is part of agile’s empirical focus. Through a modular approach to software development, users help design,
develop, and test working software throughout the period
of performance to confirm that functionality has been delivered. Business acceptance (of the functionality being
delivered) is critical to success in agile, so subject matter
experts and senior program managers alike should expec
o work closely with the development team on a daily basis. The processes used to deliver functionality are not important and cannot be predicted, so detailed specifications
and product schemas are replaced with user input, acceptance criteria, and, ultimately, user acceptance. This is a
dramatic shift from the robust requirements and lengthy
specifications characteristic of waterfall development and
will ease the burden of the acquisition team by reducing
he paperwork and planning required to develop working
software.
By collaborating with customers, agile developers gain
an understanding of end user needs and use that understanding to deliver software that supports functionality.
Creating detailed specifications and project plans can be
wasteful and can prevent practitioners from incorporating

hat we have an understanding of the agile philosophy,
let’s examine the basic concepts of the agile developmen
life cycle. The sidebar at right defines the terms common
o the agile life cycle, so you can familiarize yourself with
his terminology before reading further.

What is the agile development life cycle?
The agile development life cycle starts with a produc
vision that describes at a high level the functionality of the
software that will be developed. The product vision is useful as a statement of need and serves as a guide for breaking work into functional elements. When a product vision is
broken down into functional elements, it provides a statement of objectives (SOO) or statement of work (SOW)
hat allows the agile development team to further define
he level of effort and tasks required to deliver working
software in support of that functionality. (See the graphic
below.)
After the product vision is broken down into functional
elements, the agile team conducts preliminary planning to
determine how many releases of working software will
be required to deliver the functionality described in the
product vision. This effort results in the product road map,
which demonstrates how the efforts of the developmen
eam will yield continuous delivery of working software
o the end users. Keep in mind the product road map is
a living document; it is intended to evolve throughout the
development effort as feedback and lessons learned are
gathered by the agile team.

How does the product road map support
agile implementation?
The product road map is used by the agile team to conduct “just enough” planning to determine the specific effort, coding, and engineering tasks that will be required to
produce working software.4 Each functional element envisioned in the product road map is converted to a release
of working software, but only one release is planned at a
ime, to allow the development team to incorporate lessons learned into future releases.
The effort required to provide functionality through the
delivery of working software is called a “sprint,” and a
release plan can include as many sprints as are required to
deliver working software, within the schedule and budge
resources allotted to the release. Therefore, a release plan
consumes budget and schedule resources available to the
project; as additional releases are planned, they continue
o consume schedule and budget resources in a process
known as “the burn.” The graphic below shows how each
release of working software consumes schedule and budget, in effect “burning down” the product road map.

Product Vision
The product vision is broken down into “chunks” of work that deliver incremental
functionality to an end user. When combined, each chunk enables realization of the
full product vision, but offers “stand-alone” functionality.

As the agile team completes each release, it is tested
against a set of acceptance criteria and metrics established during the release planning process before being
deployed in the production (e.g., live) environment where
it is available to end users as working software. Additional
features that support the product vision or bug fixes for
released software are maintained in the product backlog,
where they can be incorporated into releases that finish
ahead of schedule or into an entirely new release (presuming that schedule and budget resources are available,
as is the case with “nice to have” features).
The agile team continues to plan each release individually, complete the work through sprints, and deploy
working software to the production environment until the
functionality has been achieved or all schedule and budge
resources have been consumed. To gain a better understanding of the consumption of resources in agile development, let’s consider what it is we are actually buying in
an agile acquisition.

What are we buying in agile
development?
In agile development, we are buying effort (e.g., services) in support of functionality, which is continuously delivered through the release of working software. Think of the
scope of an agile acquisition as the creation of functionality
in support of the product vision within the constraints of
schedule and budget. Any feature or software that can be
created and delivered within the constraints of schedule
and budget should be considered within scope. The graphic at right depicts the concept of scope as functionality.
Notice in the graphic how each release consumes
available budget and schedule resources while delivering
functionality along the product road map. With each release, the product backlog shrinks, as do available budge
and schedule resources. As long as the additional features
support the functionality described in the SOO and are delivered within schedule and budget constraints, they may
be considered within the scope of the contract. This alleviates a primary obstacle to enabling agile success through
current acquisition methods, although it will require a degree of cultural change within the organization to accep
his principle of “scope as functionality.”
One final note about what is being procured through
agile development: You are buying services in support of
a product, not the product itself, because the product can
change as the organization’s needs change. New features
can be added or obviated based on lessons learned by the
agile team, so the exact features and functionality of the
end-state product should not be fully defined. These fea4

Scope as Functionality

tures (and the end-state product itself) are subject to the
learning that occurs during each release of working software and the efficiency of the development effort. As we
have described, agile development has the ability to deliver functionality in excess of the original vision, so long
as that functionality supports the product vision. This will
have an impact on how you choose to structure your acquisition strategy, as we detail in the following sections.

Acquisition Strategies to Enable
Agile Developmen
Now that we have reviewed the agile development life
cycle, we are ready to consider acquisition strategies tha
enable agile development. The best opportunity to promote agile success is to design an acquisition strategy tha
maximizes the realization of the product vision within the
constraints of schedule and budget. To develop an appropriate acquisition strategy, we recommend using the practices described in FAR part 39, “Acquisition of Information
Technology,” to the maximum extent practicable.
A primary component of part 39 is the use of modular contracting strategies that address the risk of technical obsolescence inherent to the IT environment. You no
doubt have experienced technical obsolescence in your
personal life; the flat screen television or smartphone you
purchased last year lags the technical features of today’s
model. In acquiring IT for the federal government, obsolescence is a primary concern and discourages the use of
waterfall development, where all features and functions
are deployed at the end of the product development cycle.
Modular contracting is beneficial to acquiring IT, and your
## ASI GOVERNMENT

Advisory
strategy should seek to enable these benefits by employing the principles described in FAR part 39.

What considerations are useful in
creating a successful acquisition strategy
for agile development?
In its June 2012 report, “Contracting Guidance to Support Modular Development,” OMB recommends three
strategies for enabling agile development: indefinitedelivery vehicles (IDVs), stand-alone contracts, and successive contracts. Each strategy has its own utility, and
he selection should be informed by the characteristics of
your software development needs. For an enterprise-wide
software deployment effort, an IDV offers the advantage
of consistency among the program team and the ability to
divide the product vision into smaller chunks (e.g., modules) that can be delivered through task orders. In addition, an IDV can enable the use of multiple contractors for
different elements of the product vision, or provide for a
systems integrator that can provide project managemen
assistance to the overall program.
A stand-alone contract is useful for smaller products
hat can be developed in the near term and do not require
extensive integration with legacy systems. A stand-alone
contract will require more support from the acquisition
eam to support the agile development effort and make
end users available to inform the release planning process. For products that are more complex in nature, or will
require extensive integration with legacy systems, a successive contract strategy that adheres to the guidelines of
FAR 39.103, “Modular Contracting,” may be required. If
successive contracts are envisioned, you should consider
he procurement life cycle at your agency to determine
how quickly those successive contracts can be awarded.
If too much time elapses between contracts, the progress
of the agile development effort will suffer.

What considerations will inform the
selection of contract type?
Once the acquisition strategy is completed, you will
need to determine the type of contract that will be used.
Unfortunately, there is no formula for selecting the righ
contract type, as it depends largely on the nature of your
requirement and the placement of that effort within a
broader program or agency requirement. Our thoughts on
several of these options follow:
• Fixed-price contracts can be challenging because
hey elicit more of the “big bang” procurement approach,
where vendors are asked to deliver a predetermined

FAR Guidance at 39.103(e)
To avoid obsolescence, a modular contract for information
echnology should, to the maximum extent practicable,
be awarded within 180 days after the date on which the
solicitation is issued. . . . To the maximum extent practicable,
deliveries under the contract should be scheduled to occur
within 18 months after issuance of the solicitation.

contractual outcome (e.g., software product) that often
is influenced by rigorous price competition. Fixed-price
contracts may have an adverse impact on the agile development life cycle by inhibiting the incorporation of lessons learned into subsequent release planning, because
unforeseen challenges must be accommodated through
contractual administration (e.g., modifications and change
orders). This can lengthen the time between releases and
reduce the return on your software investment given the
risk of technical obsolescence.
• Cost-type contracts offer the advantages of schedule and cost flexibility, which are important in an agile
development effort. Cost-type contracts also can be incentivized to motivate performance, and can enable functionality to be delivered at a lower cost than a fixed-price
contract because the government has more control over
funding decisions and the progress of development. Cos
contracts are well suited for agile development because
hey allow the incremental delivery of working software,
hough they require a level of experience and expertise
from the acquisition team and strong support from acquisition leadership. Cost-type contracts also have their own
unique requirements for cost analysis [as described in
FAR 15.404-1(c)], though these requirements offer significant advantages over an evaluation based on total produc
price. Also keep in mind that cost-type contracts require
additional administration and oversight because contractors have less incentive to control total costs. Applying
an award or incentive fee structure to contractual performance will mitigate this risk, but such structures do require significant postaward surveillance.
• Time-and-Materials and Labor Hour contracts (TM/
LH) are worth consideration, given the focus of agile development on the continuous delivery of functionality. TM/
LH contracts allow the government to purchase a not-toexceed (NTE) amount of service in support of the overall
product vision. This is consistent with our guidance tha
he scope of an agile development effort should be bound
only by schedule and budget constraints. As long as the
NTE amount is not breached, a TM/LH type contract for
agile development can enable the delivery of functionality

Advisory
in excess of what was originally estimated, so long as i
can be linked to the product vision. Keep in mind that TM/
LH contract types require the acquisition professional to
document in a determination and findings document why
no other contract type is suitable. Therefore, a thorough
review and analysis of FAR subpart 16.6 should be conducted prior to selecting this contract type. In supporting
your determination and findings document, consider using
an incentive structure whereby future business (perhaps
in the form of sprints or additional releases) can be earned
hrough effective management and reporting of hours
burned. This offers a way to control costs and promote
efficiency, thereby addressing a frequent criticism associated with the use of this contract type.

What are some other considerations
when determining acquisition strategy
and contract type?
Incentive fees and other structures such as award
erms have utility for agile development. These incentives
can be predicated on successful completion of individual
releases, which can be included in modular contracting
structures described in FAR 39.103. Agile developmen
does require an element of consistency throughout the
process, so incentivizing performance through the promise of future work not only supports government surveillance but also motivates the contractor to work within
ime, schedule, and technical constraints.
For larger efforts, an IDV approach provides flexibility
o award task orders for each release plan. If your total
value is under $108 million, you can defend a single award
indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, bu
beyond that threshold, a multiple award IDIQ is likely to
be required.5 Plan accordingly, as all awardees must have
fair opportunity for consideration of task and delivery order awards throughout the contractual life cycle, and this
will increase your procurement cycle time. This can affec
he execution of future task orders, which is important because consistency and efficiency are essential to realizing
he benefits of agile development.
Hybrid contract types hold promise for agile software
development. IDVs enable hybrid contract types, where
fixed price orders can be let for project and release planning exercises. Then, TM/LH or cost-reimbursable contract types can be used for the actual development of
working software. If working with firm fixed price type
contracts, you may explore the possibility of including language within the contract that enables the conversion of
contract type to something more suitable for supporting
release planning and execution, such as cost or TM/LH.

A Note on Section 508
When developing IT products and services, it is necessary to
comply with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,
which addresses accessibility for individuals with disabilities.
The integrated product team member representing your
Office of the Chief Information Officer should be sure to
coordinate with your agency’s section 508 compliance office
when developing requirements for IT products and services.

Conversely, cost or TM/LH type task orders can be let for
early releases until a better understanding of schedule and
budget requirements is gained, at which point fixed price
orders can be let for subsequent releases.
For smaller efforts, single award contracts can address
he procurement cycle time issue, but then the requirement must be developed to enable the progression of release plan execution. In these structures, priced options,
incentives, and award terms can be useful tools to monitor and motivate contractor performance. If awarding to
a small business, you also can take advantage of OMB’s
guidance to accelerate payments (within 15 days of performance targets) to the small business so that it has the
working capital to continue its development efforts.6
The bottom line consideration when selecting contrac
ype is that it should be driven by the goal of enabling
ordering efficiency, or efficiency in continuously delivering
working software. Ideally, you can award contracts with
periods of performance that are 6, 12, or 18 months in
duration (consistent with FAR 39.103), where the end deliverable is working software described by the product vision. Consider the culture and history of your agency when
selecting your contract type. Whatever your choice, you
must ensure the rapid and efficient execution of contracts
or task orders for the development of working software
while managing performance so that outcomes, rather
han process, are the determinants of successful delivery.

Are performance-based acquisition
echniques appropriate for agile?
Absolutely. Agile development projects require a scope
of work that allows for flexibility and change, so you can
add great value throughout the acquisition process by using performance-based acquisition (PBA) techniques. In
addition, because agile development uses “just enough”
planning to deliver working software in support of the
product vision, PBA allows the acquisition professional to
focus on functionality rather than complex requirements
definition and strict adherence to project plans.
## ASI GOVERNMENT

Advisory
In the planning phases, the acquisition professional
should require an integrated project team (IPT) inclusive
of program owners, end users, and IT professionals who
will work together to create the high-level product vision and ensure consistency with your organization’s IT
environment. In supporting the IPT during the planning
phase, the acquisition professional should focus on defining the constraints of schedule and budget so the IPT
understands the resources available to the project. This
informs the identification of features that must be delivered to achieve the desired functionality within those
constraints. Additional features can be delivered when allowed by schedule and budget, and avoiding the prescriptive requirements characteristic of waterfall developmen
provides the agile team with more flexibility to deliver
functionality in the most efficient manner.
In addition, when using PBA to acquire IT services under
FAR part 39, you are directed to neither prescribe nor require minimum experience or educational requirements for
proposed contractor personnel.7 This is important because
we rely on the expertise of our agile vendors to propose
he latest and greatest skills necessary to deliver working
software. They should have the autonomy to provide resources capable of enabling the product vision based on
heir experience in software development, not ours.

Who should be included in the IPT?
Agile software development requires constant and
continuous collaboration, not just among developers and
project owners, but with all stakeholders of the project.
OMB recommends assembling an IPT with well-defined
roles and responsibilities. Given that a fundamental requirement for agile success is reliance on collaboration,
we recommend taking advantage of the acquisition planning process to ensure all appropriate team members are
identified, and have them (and their supervisors) commi
ime and resources to supporting the project by contributing to and signing the IPT charter.
While the composition of your IPT will depend on your
specific circumstances, certain roles must be included.
The product owner is the most important, because this
individual represents the business. The product owner
should have executive-level authority and available bandwidth to support the project on a daily basis, because he
or she will be required to make decisions that affect the
ultimate functionality of the working software. Additional
roles that must be included in the IPT are outlined in the
graphic above. It includes a representative(s) from the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) who will be
integral in thinking through the technical and infrastruc-

How does the product vision support development of a statement of objectives?
As illustration, let’s consider how we would use PBA
o procure a contract writing system with an agile development philosophy. The agile development life cycle
starts with a high-level product vision that describes the
functions that will be delivered through working software.
A good practice in developing the product vision, which is
driven by the product owner, is to start by describing a
a high level the functionality required. Once a high-level
functionality is written, the IPT can break that down into
a product vision that describes the functions required to
deliver ultimate functionality, as depicted in the graphic
below. In this case, we created a SOO that decomposes
he high-level functionality described in the product vision
into four functional elements (planning & presolicitation,
solicitation & preaward, award, and postaward) that mus
be developed to produce our contract writing system.

Advisory
How do I use the SOO?
Rather than prescribe to a developer how it should create the software required to enable functionality, PBA encourages vendors to demonstrate the results of their efforts. In this manner, PBA supports the principle of “jus
enough” planning by describing desired functionality in
a SOO and then having vendors propose a performance
work statement (PWS) against that SOO. This preserves
he ability for the agile vendor to leverage its experience
while providing the opportunity to incorporate lessons
learned into the production cycle. Strictly defined requirements documents do not enable such flexibility and thus
are barriers to the full realization of agile benefits.
While the SOO should focus on outcomes, it also
should include constraints and environmental conditions
relevant to your IT and program environment. It is within
hese constraints that the agile development team mus
operate, so you must describe any legacy software development requirements, security policies, and relevan
IT policies or procedures, as they will have an impact on
he development of working software. Your IPT will be
especially helpful in identifying these constraints, and is
a primary reason why representatives from the OCIO are
invaluable members of the agile IPT.

Does the SOO bind the agile team to
deliver specific requirements?
No, the SOO should not bind the agile team to deliver a specific set of functional requirements. This is important because if the desired functionality is delivered
ahead of schedule and within the allotted budget, the
agile team can use the remaining time allotted for tha
release to develop additional features in support of the
product vision. As the agile development team works to
deliver functionality in support of the product vision described in the SOO, the acquisition professional should
focus on two primary constraints: schedule and budget.
In this manner, an agile development effort has the potential to deliver functionality in excess of what initially
was envisioned by the product vision within the contractual limitations of budget and schedule, rather than only
he prescribed functionality predicted in a traditional waterfall development requirements suite.
A SOO that breaks the product vision into functional
elements will enable vendors to propose a PWS that demonstrates the result of their development efforts through
he continuous delivery of working software. Upon award,
he PWS is used to guide the development effort through
creation of the product road map, which guides the re8

lease planning activities that deliver functional outcomes
described in the SOO. Agile development’s goal of delivering maximum functionality in support of the produc
vision within the constraints of schedule and budget essentially requires that we include in the solicitation the
budget available to the project, which can be expressed
as a ceiling amount or NTE amount. As we discuss in
he next section, this presents a unique challenge to the
evaluation of vendor proposals.

Evaluation of Proposals
A primary challenge that must be addressed in acquiring agile development is the notion that vendor-proposed
PWSs do not enable an “apples to apples” comparison
of proposals. Each vendor-proposed PWS will be unique;
some will propose more releases than others, but so long
as the functionality being delivered can be achieved, this
is not a concern. However, it does put pressure on the
evaluation process and necessitates a creative approach
o technical and price evaluation.
Let’s recall the contract writing system example as
we consider an approach to evaluating vendor-proposed
PWSs. A good place to start thinking through this is to
identify the primary categories of proposal evaluation:
echnical, past performance, and price.

Technical Evaluation for Agile
For our contract writing system, we want to differentiate between vendor proposals in terms of their technical
understanding and capability to continuously deliver working software. A good place to start is to consider how their
PWSs support the product road map, and whether the order of functionality-to-be-delivered makes sense for the
end-state working software. For instance, if a vendor proposes to deliver working software in support of contrac
closeout before delivering award functionality, this may
indicate a lack of technical understanding and increased
echnical risk (unless accompanied by supporting logic).
In addition, we should request that vendors include
in their proposals a description of how they manage the
implementation of their own agile principles. What is their
echnique for release planning? Do they have a plan to engage with end users to understand the features that mus
be delivered in support of the functionality envisioned by
hat release? How do they capture lessons learned relevant to the software development effort and use those
lessons to increase the efficiency of future releases? Key
elements to consider are their use of collaborative forums
## ASI GOVERNMENT

Advisory
for sharing information across the team, their testing and
quality assurance process, their approach to configuration
management, and their appreciation for engaging with end
users in the conduct of “just enough” release planning.

Should we evaluate the vendor’s staffing
approach?
Absolutely. Staffing approach is a key element of the
echnical evaluation. Evaluation criteria for an agile staffing approach should seek to understand the vendor’s
resource talent and ability to leverage a diverse array of
development resources. Request that vendors propose a
rationale for choosing the development talent and projec
oversight personnel based on the functionality described
in the product vision (recall that FAR part 39 directs us
not to prescribe any minimum experience or educational
requirement for proposed contractor personnel when using PBA to acquire IT). This will help the evaluation team
differentiate between agile vendors during the source selection process.
One potential pitfall is to require the designation of
multiple key personnel. We recommend designating only
one team member as key personnel—the project manager. When developing software, especially in a federal environment rich with legacy IT infrastructure, it is challenging to predict which coding languages and engineering
echniques will be required. Key personnel designations
for staff members beyond the project manager may limi
he vendor’s ability to source its talent pool for specific
resources and expertise that can add value during the execution of a release plan.
Remember, in agile development we are buying effort in support of functionality; vendors that offer experienced developers at a fair and reasonable price are mos
attractive to the government because they are likely to
perform better and more efficiently than inexperienced
coders. This is not a rule, however. Some developmen
asks are more basic and may not necessitate experienced talent. Rather than prescribing the resources we
hink are required, we are better off instructing offerors to
demonstrate why they composed the team in the manner
hey did. We should include instructions to the offerors
requesting a description of how they will make resources
available to deliver the maximum amount of functionality
within the project schedule and budget constraints.

Past Performance Evaluation for Agile
Past performance is another key category for evaluating agile proposals. We recommend you focus your pas

performance evaluation criteria on demonstrated experience with successfully developing software using an agile development approach. Because agile development is
a relatively new trend in government, it may be necessary
o allow for private-sector experience to be included. Using a template that describes the key past performance
areas you want to evaluate (such as nature of the work,
constraints within which the vendor operated, and how
it persevered in the face of project challenges and leveraged its talent pool to deliver working software) is a bes
practice and will help organize proposal information to facilitate the source selection process. In addition, instruc
all offerors to include information about the size, scope,
and complexity of their past development experience, to
include its relevancy to the software being produced via
your solicitation.

Cost and Price Analysis for Agile
Cost and price analysis for the acquisition of IT pose
a unique challenge when evaluating agile proposals in a
PBA environment. The strategy depends on contract type.
For fixed price contracts, price analysis should determine
fair and reasonable pricing using price competition (the
comparison of proposed rates when two or more responsible offers have been received) or a comparison of rates
charged to either public or private buyers for similar services. Given the relative newness of agile development in
he public sector, it may be necessary to compare prices
paid for agile development services in the private sector
if no similar federal purchase exists.
For cost reimbursement or TM/LH contracts, cost analysis or cost realism analysis will be conducted to determine whether the cost of labor (e.g., labor rates for the
developer talent) represent a fair and reasonable price to
he government. In these instances, your cost evaluation
strategy should focus on a comparison of the labor categories and rates proposed by the agile team. The cos
analysis team should review established rate lists (GSA’s
IT-70 schedule is a great place to start) and conduct marke
research to identify average rates for development expertise and experience, especially for TM/LH evaluations. In
certain instances, you may seek the assistance of personnel with specialized experience in software developmen
who can inform your analysis of labor rates proposed or
field pricing assistance if the total estimated cost of your
agile acquisition is significant.8
Conducting a price analysis for fixed price agile proposals is a unique challenge because agile developmen
can deliver functionality beyond what is described by the
product vision. When vendors propose under a fixed price

arrangement, they assume more of the risk in projec
delivery. This risk profile will encourage the agile development team to produce the basic functionality of each
release to meet the letter of the contract, and nothing
more, because any effort above and beyond the basic requirements will reduce their realized profit. This is how
fixed price contracts are meant to work, and why we are
hesitant to recommend them for agile development.

What evaluation strategy should be used
o achieve best value?
Price must be a consideration when evaluating agile
development proposals, but the focus on delivering as
much functionality as possible within budget and schedule
constraints makes it challenging for the acquisition team
o evaluate total proposed price. If our primary constraints
are schedule and budget, and the delivery of working software is contingent on the incorporation of lessons learned
into the release planning process, a high-performing agile
eam may succeed in delivering the product vision for less
han the budgeted amount. Depending on the nature of
he software required, this may be sufficient and could
result in an early termination of the project for the government’s convenience. So how can best value be achieved
when evaluating agile development proposals?
We strongly advise against the use of a lowest price,
echnically acceptable approach. Instead, we advocate
he use of trade-offs that enable the evaluation team to
consider other-than price factors such as the offeror’s
proposed staffing approach and specific implementation
and project management techniques. Using trade-offs will
allow you to make a best value determination not for delivering working software for the lowest possible investment, but for delivering the highest degree of working
software within the constraints of schedule and budget.

Postaward Steps
What is the next step after the award
decision is made?
Upon award, the PWS will be used to guide the development effort through creation of the product road map
and release planning activities that deliver functional outcomes described in the SOO. Therefore, the first step
after award is to schedule a contract kickoff meeting as
soon as possible. This kickoff meeting must include the
IPT, and it should be presented as an opportunity for the
awardee to review its PWS with all project stakeholders.

Because agile relies on collaboration and input from
end users, a kickoff session is a great opportunity to establish a collaborative mind-set early in the process. If
members of the IPT have questions or concerns abou
he road map, they should feel free to discuss them with
he development team. They can then incorporate these
issues into their planning effort for the first release. In addition, a best practice when using PBA is to incorporate
he winning proposal’s PWS into the resulting contract,
where it will serve as the product road map and guide
he release planning activities necessary to continuously
deliver working software.

How do you know when a release is
complete?
During the release planning process, the agile team
will need to interview end users to determine wha
features of the software must be deployed through individual sprints to support performance or functionality.
These interviews result in user stories that describe the
functions—not the specifications—of the sprints. They
also describe attributes of the working software that will
dictate the user acceptance testing used to determine
whether the software is ready for deployment. The user
acceptance testing requirements are aggregated into an
overall “definition of done” for the current release. The
“definition of done” is an important tool for the acquisition professional as it helps to bind the scope of an agile procurement. Without a definition of done, it would
be impossible to determine when the agile developmen
project has achieved its contractual purpose.

When is the functionality deployed?
After completing a release, working software is demonstrated to the IPT and presented to end users for acceptance testing, providing all members of the agile development effort an opportunity to determine how the
software performs. Software that passes the demonstration and testing phase is deployed to the production environment, where it is available to support the job role of
he end user.
This is a fundamental element of agile development—
working software is deployed within an organization
hroughout the life cycle so end users can benefit from
he project investment in advance of contract expiration.
The graphic on page 11 depicts the process of release
planning and testing that occurs prior to the deploymen
of working software, within the context of acquiring our
contract writing system example.

• The awardee’s PWS intends to deliver the planning
and presolicitation functionality for the contract writing
system in the first release.
• The IPT and agile developers work to break the firs
release into sprints.

How do you measure and monitor
performance?
Agile development relies on empirical evidence, meaning that demonstrated functionality is of primary importance for contractor surveillance. This challenges the
raditional design of performance measures and monitoring tools that rely on a set of prescribed or promised outcomes. Using service level agreements (SLAs) and other
outcome-based metrics that describe functionality (e.g.,
usability) will increase visibility into project performance
and contractual expenditures.
As we have described, agile development is not concerned with how working software is achieved, so long
as it is within the constraints of schedule and budget.
Progress in agile development is assessed through the
eam’s ability to deliver working software in an efficien
and timely manner. This is a concept known as “produc
velocity,” and high performing agile teams will increase
heir velocity over time, meaning they become more efficient and proficient at developing software within the
constraints of their project environment. There are tools
and methods available for measuring product velocity;
you may request that each vendor propose its preferred
ool or conduct your own research to select one tha
works best for your need.
The exact SLAs and metrics will vary based on the nature of the development effort, so we recommend work-

• Each sprint will create functionality in support of the
first release.
• Release 1 will provide working software to end users
in support of contract writing functionality by enabling
planning and presolicitation activities.

ing with the agile team and your IPT to create a performance management strategy as a contractual deliverable.
To get the conversation started, examples of SLAs and
other agile-focused performance measures may include:
• Conduct of release planning activities
• Creation and closure of user stories through the completion of sprints
• Rate at which the product backlog is reduced (a concept known as “velocity”)
• Posting of lessons learned through early releases into
a collaborative environment to support software development in future releases
Working with the agile practitioners and the IPT to develop a performance management plan will ensure the
acquisition professional can maintain project visibility and
meet reporting expectations while not interfering with the
development effort. Requesting that vendors propose a
quality assurance plan as part of their proposal packages
is another best practice and can serve as a further tool for
echnical evaluation.
Key Concept: Agile performance measures should be
structured around individual releases, rather than the produc
vision, so they can evolve along with the working software.
In this manner, outcome measures and their modalities can
adapt to accommodate the progress and direction of the agile
development team.

How do I know if my agency is ready for
agile?
Agile requires a full commitment from the organization
o be successful. Using agile terminology might make
your agency feel like it is embracing agile development,
but maximizing the return on an agile development project requires a full embrace of its fundamentals. Below are
several questions to help you determine whether your organization is ready to use agile development. If your organization does not exhibit these traits, it may be helpful to
conduct an agile readiness assessment, championed by
he product owner with participation from the IPT.

 Does my agency share information freely across
component groups?
Agile teams must have access to information such as
current code and legacy software development requirements. These are primary inputs for the developmen
eam to consider as it produces working software, and
lack of access to such information or legacy developmen
requirements will hamper the agile practitioners.
If your agency has a strong collaborative environment,
such as a SharePoint site or similar collaboration tool, this
is a good sign your organizational culture will support agile development. If programs are constantly affected by
hierarchy, stovepipes, or an unwillingness to share information across components, you should consider this a
cultural “red flag” that should be addressed prior to pursuing agile development.

 Does my agency embrace cross-functional teams?
To get all the right players involved in an agile development project, resources from across the organization
must have the support of their leadership to devote the
necessary time to an agile project. If IPTs are a frequen
occurrence in your acquisition environment, and are used
o their full advantage, this is a sign your agency is in position to embrace the fundamentals of agile development.
If IPTs are chartered at the beginning of a project bu
do not provide regular support and assistance throughou
he acquisition life cycle, this is a warning sign. Collaboration from all team members is fundamental to the success of an agile development project. Saying resources
will be made available and actually following through on
hat commitment are two very different things. Team
members who support an agile project, such as end users, must have the support of their supervisors to pu
on hold their current work to support an agile development effort. Team members also must have requisite
autonomy (or authority, in the case of the product own12
   
March 2014 

er) to make product- and process-related decisions on a
daily basis that will affect ultimate product development.
This is necessary to honor the schedule and budget constraints of the agile development cycle.

 Does my agency enable its acquisition function to
work with efficiency?
Regardless of the acquisition strategy and contrac
ype selected to support an agile development, the acquisition team must be able to efficiently award contracts
and execute contractual processes. If your agency’s acquisition process is hampered by interference from third
parties, inefficient secondary reviews, or undocumented
practices, this can affect your ability to enable successful
agile development outcomes.
While we do not advocate that acquisition professionals work with unconditional autonomy, we note that delays in the acquisition process that arise when acquisition
strategies are challenged or changed after contract award
will limit the benefits of agile development. If your agency’s peer review process can approve contracting recommendations in the short term, this is a positive sign tha
your organizational culture will enable agile development.
But if your acquisition function struggles to gain secondary approval for acquisition strategies that are permissible
by policy and regulation, this can hinder the agile development process. If these struggles cannot be solved prior to
moving forward with an agile development procurement,
you likely will want to consider alternative strategies for
your software development needs.

Conclusion
Agile development is a powerful philosophy for delivering successful software products within today’s dynamic
IT landscape. Acquisition professionals do not have to be
experts in all aspects of agile development to support an
agile project, but understanding its principles will enable
hem to structure an acquisition strategy that will enable
realization of its full potential.
As agile development continues to expand through
federal and private sector adoption, organizations will become more accustomed to its radically simple approach.
Federal organizations that wish to take advantage of its
benefits must be prepared to fully embrace its principles.
While this may require a significant degree of change
management to foster project management and acquisition disciplines within the organizations, agencies tha
blaze this trail will realize an IT environment that adapts
o change and continuously delivers value through timely
and useful working software.
