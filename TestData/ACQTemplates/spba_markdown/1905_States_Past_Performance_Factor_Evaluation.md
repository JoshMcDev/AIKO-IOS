The Offeror shall submit the following information as part of their proposal for both the Offeror and
proposed major subcontractors:
(a) A list of all contracts and subcontracts completed during the past 3 years and all contracts and
subcontracts currently in process for projects similar in size and complexity to the requirements
stated in Section B.2. Contracts listed may include those entered into by other departments and
agencies of the Federal Government; contracts with state and local governments; and contracts with
commercial customers. An offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral
rating, i.e., the rating will not add to or detract from its Past Performance rating. Include the
following information for each contract and subcontract:
(1) Name of contracting activity;
(2) Contract number;
(3) Contract type;
(4) Total contract value;
(5) Contracting officer and telephone number;
(6) Program manager, telephone number, and facsimile number;
(7) Description of project;
(8) Administrative contracting officer, if different from (v) above, and
elephone number; and
(9) List of major subcontractors/teaming partners.
(b) The Offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and
subcontracts identified in paragraph (1) above, and corrective actions taken to resolve those
problems. The Offeror should not provide general information on its performance on the identified
contracts; general performance information will be obtained from the references.
(c) The Offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the Offeror has a
high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or
certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other Governmen
quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications (e.g., the automobile industry's QS 9000,
ANSI/ASQC Q9002-1994, Sematech's SSQA, or ANSI/EIA-599). Identify what segment of the
company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when
he award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, presen
evidence that the qualifications still apply.
(d) The Offeror will be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar
products or services. Performance information will be used as an evaluation factor as required in
he FAR 15.304(c)(3). The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of
performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.

References other than those identified by the Offeror may be contacted by the Government, with the
information received used in the evaluation of the Offeror's past performance.
