“Feed a man a fish and he eats for a day.
Teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime.”
Statement of Objectives.
The U.S. Customs Service desires to create and execute a
comprehensive strategy for exceeding the Administration’s goals relating to
Performance Based Contracting. The objective is nothing short of a cultural
ransformation: The Customs Service will use Performance Based Contracting
(PBC) methods whenever feasible for acquiring services. The expected outcome
will be that PBC is the standard business practice within Customs acquisition.
The offerors are required to propose a comprehensive strategy for
achieving this outcome. While offerors have complete flexibility to propose their
own solutions, the Customs Service offers the following ideas that might be
useful to offerors in preparing their proposed strategies:
•

The Customs workforce will have been mostly trained in the objectives
and methods of Performance Based Contracting prior to the start of
his contract. The contractor should review workforce training to date
o assure adequacy to purpose and to identify any gaps in training tha
must be filled to achieve a successful outcome.

•

The contractor should develop an effective marketing strategy that will
assure that all customers are educated regarding the purpose and
methods of Performance Based Contracting, and should facilitate its
execution.

•

It is critical that the Customs workforce is enabled to take the tenets of
Performance Based Contracting and employ them through hands-on
practice. The contractor should develop the various marketing tools
needed to assist the contracting workforce in their marketing efforts.

•

The contractor should assist contracting and customer personnel in
ransforming new procurements to Performance Based Acquisitions,
especially regarding acquisition strategies, statements of objectives,
contract performance measures, and source selection planning.

•

The contractor should provide an effective means to assess lessons
learned from individual procurements and to effectively disseminate
hese lessons back to the contracting and customer workforces.

•

The contractor should provide an effective effort to identify and review
current contracts that are not performance based and facilitate their
potential transition to a Performance Based Contract.

•

Because the ultimate objective is to create an organization (i.e., the
Customs Service) that is fully able to independently execute a
Performance Based Contracting strategy, the contractor should
propose performance measures for this contract that will effectively
demonstrate whether this objective is being achieved.
