LOGISTICS
The duration of a CSAW is generally four (4) days for an in-person workshop, though more complex
acquisitions may require follow-on sessions. Virtual CSAWs may take place over five (5) days with shorter
segments. CSAWs are most effective when facilitated in-person, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will
be primarily delivering virtual workshops well into FY 2021. Complete a ​CSAW Intake Form​ to get started.
