PART 1 – THE SCHEDULE
SECTION B – GENERAL DESRIPTION AND PRICE SCHEDULE
B.1 PROGRAM OBJECTIVE
The COMMerce Information Technology Solutions Next Generation (COMMITS
NexGen) program is an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) task order contrac
designed to provide the Federal Government with Information Technology (IT) solutions.
The objective of the COMMITS NexGen program is to become the Government-wide
Agency Contract (GWAC) vehicle of choice for Federal Government to meet its demand
for high-quality competitive Information Technology (IT) solutions from a pool of
exceptionally qualified, high quality small, small disadvantaged, small 8(a), small
women-owned, small veteran-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, and small
HUBZone businesses.
B.2 WORK ESTIMATES & ROLES
The COMMITS program office does not have projects designated for COMMITS
NexGen program and they are not guaranteed to be forthcoming. The COMMITS
NexGen GWAC will provide agencies a low risk alternative of placing task orders with
small businesses. However, agencies/potential clients of these contracts will make their
own decisions on the benefits of utilizing COMMITS NexGen pool of small businesses in
his program for IT requirements. The requirements may range from simple to highly
complex. At this time the breakdown of contract types for task orders issued under
COMMITS NexGen is unknown, as is the location of work and the breakdown of
Government site and Contractor site work. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding
he amount of supplies, travel and other direct costs that will be required.
The Department will be obligated to partners only for services, items and quantities
specified in a valid task order under an awarded contract or, in the event of no order
issuance for the minimum established.
B.3 CAR 1352.216-70 CONTRACT TYPE (MAR 2000)
This multiple award Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract provides for
Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Labor Hours; Time-andMaterials; and Fixed Price Award Fee; Firm-Fixed-Price Level –of-Effort term, type task
orders with options in task order awards. The contract provides for a base ordering
period from contract award through December 31, 2004, four one-year options for
awarding task orders, and five one-year options for completing task order performance.
B.4 CAR 1352.216-72 Minimum and Maximum Contract Amounts (MAR 2000)
During the period specified in the Ordering Clause ( FAR 52.216-18), the Governmen
shall place orders totaling a minimum of $150.00. The amount of all orders shall no
exceed $8,000,000,000.00.

Solicitation No. CM1301-03-RP-0019

Section B
B.5 FULFILLING MINIMUM ORDERING REQUIREMENTS
The Government has no obligation to issue task orders to the Contractor beyond the
minimum amount specified above ($150.00). While the awarded contractors will receive
he minimum, it is intended that the contractors will compete for that amount under the
contract’s fair opportunity procedures. If at the end of the contract, which includes
exercise of all options, a contractor has not been awarded a task order(s) of at leas
$150.00 in total value, the COMMITS program office will direct awards to meet the
contractual obligation. Once the contractor has received task orders valued at the
minimum, the Contractor will continue to have the opportunity to be issued task order(s)
under the COMMITS contract unless notified by the COMMITS CO in accordance with
Clause G.11. The exercise of an option does not re-establish the contract minimum.
The specific solution including services, products, quantities, and performance metrics
will be identified by the contractors proposal and incorporated into each delivery order.
The maximum cumulative dollar amount that may potentially be awarded, to all
contractors combined, under COMMITS is $8,000,000,000.

Section C
SECTION C – DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS
C.1 BACKGROUND
The principal goal of the Commerce Information Technology Solutions Next Generation
(COMMITS NexGen) program is to continue the momentum established by the
COMMITS predecessor. COMMITS NexGen will provide an attractive alternative GWAC
vehicle that allows small businesses to change the way Government IT problems are
solved. The GWAC is established under the explicit statutory authority of the ClingerCohen legislation, to provide a pool of exceptionally qualified, high quality small, small
disadvantaged, small 8(a), small women-owned, small veteran-owned, and service
disabled veteran-owned, and small HUBZone businesses. These partners then deliver
information technology solutions to the Department of Commerce and other Federal
agencies through a performance based, streamlined method of acquisition.
In accordance with FAR 16.5, the Department intends to award multiple indefinite
delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to a pool of industry partners.
The contracts will have a five-year task ordering period within a 10-year performance
period. Performance under each task order will not exceed a10-year period. While no
pre-set number of contracts is established, the goal is to award a reasonable number
considering such factors as:
•
•
•

maintaining sufficient number of partners to ensure adequate competition
for issuing task orders throughout COMMITS NexGen task ordering
period;
avoiding unnecessary and burdensome contract administration; and,
ensuring that winning partners have the opportunity to receive a
meaningful level of task order work.

The COMMITS NexGen contract program is a true solutions-based vehicle. Under this
structure the contracts contain neither fixed labor rates nor categories, nor do they
contain pre-established line items. The COMMITS NexGen solution approach does no
limit the partners to predefined contract line items. For each fair-opportunity task order
competition, the COMMITS NexGen partners are free to identify and propose the bes
solution, with the focus on results. Unless exempted (see FAR 16.505(b)(2)), each task
order will be competed under the COMMITS fair opportunity competitive procedures
(see attachment J – 1). The COMMITS Fair Opportunity competitive procedures will
maintain an ongoing competitive environment throughout the life of the contracts. Free
from the constraints of prescribed CLINS and products, the solution-based structure will
significantly improve each contractor’s ability to craft innovative and state-of-the-ar
solutions.
C.2 SCOPE
COMMITS NexGen is a broad "solutions" based vehicle. The contract scope includes all
products and services necessary to meet the requesting activity's requirement.
COMMITS NexGen contracts are available to both the Department and other
government agencies and provide a pool of high quality talent from which to acquire
information technology services and solutions. Work may be performed at headquarters
and/or field offices located throughout the United States and abroad.

Section C
This procurement is set-aside for small businesses qualified under numerous North
American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes. A description of these NAICS
codes is provided in Section C.4. The use of multiple NAICS codes at different levels
allows the program to support a wide variety of IT requirements on a task order basis.
The use of multiple NAICS codes result in multiple size standards which includes: $6
million, $12.5 million, $21 million, 500 employees, and 1500 employees.
The COMMITS NexGen will use a three-tier process for task order competition. As
described in the chart below, the ordering methodology will utilize a three tier process for
ask order competition. Partners who certified at $6 million or $12.5 million size
standards will be allowed to compete on task orders with a life cycle value of equal to or
less than $5 million (Tier I). Partners who certified at $21 million or 500 employees will
be allowed to compete on task orders with a life cycle value between $5 million and $70
million (Tier II). Partners who certified at 1500 employees will only be allowed to
compete on task orders with a life cycle value of more than $70 million (Tier III).

SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
H.1 TYPE OF CONTRACT
This is a multiple award Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with
provisions for Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Labor
Hours, Time-and-Materials, and Fixed Price Award Fee, FFP Level –of-Effort Term type
ask orders. The type of contract selected will be determined by task order based on the
criteria contained in FAR 16.1, Selecting Contract Types and the contractor’s capability
o manage cost-reimbursement efforts. Only one contract type will be used on an
individual task order unless mutually agreed to by the Contractor and the cognizan
Contracting Officer.
H.2 MAXIMUM PROGRAM CEILING AND MINIMUM CONTRACT GUARANTEE
There is a contract program maximum of $8 billion over the life of all contracts under the
COMMITS NexGen GWAC. As a task order is issued against a contract, the value of
ask orders that can be issued under all contracts decreases by an equal amount. The
$8 billion ceiling is not a contractual guarantee.
## THE GUARANTEED MINIMUM PER ORIGINAL AWARD IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
DOLLARS ($150.00). The Government has no obligation to issue orders to a Contractor
beyond the minimum guarantee. While Contractors are entitled to the minimum
guarantee, it is intended that they will compete for that amount under fair opportunity
procedures. Issuance of a single order or a series of orders having a cumulative value
equal to or greater than the minimum guarantee satisfies the minimum guarantee.
The exercise of an option does not re-establish, or result in an increase to, the Contrac
minimum guarantee.
The Contractor and Government agree that the minimum guarantee is adequate
consideration to establish a binding indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity Contract for the
purpose intended by the solicitation.
H.3 FAIR OPPORTUNITY ORDERING PROCEDURES
Any supplies and/or services to be furnished under this contract will be ordered by
issuance of written Task Orders (TOs), which are outlined below. TOs shall be issued in
accordance with FAR 52.216-18, 52.216-19, and 52.216-22 (See Section I). In addition
ask orders will be issued following the Fair Opportunity competitive procedures
contained in Attachment J-1. In addition:
a. Only an authorized Government Contracting Officer can issue a TO under this
contract;
b. All TOs are subject to the terms and conditions of the contract. In the event of
conflict between a TO and the contract, the contract will take precedence.

Solicitation No. CM1301-03-RP-0019

20

Section H
c. All costs associated with preparation, presentation, and/or discussion of the
Contractor's TO proposal shall be at the Contractor's expense. Post award TO
administration is an allowable expense. The Contractor is responsible for
determining the most appropriate method for recovering such costs (e.g., direc
or indirect charges to Task Orders) based on its standard accounting practices.
d. The Government will use a three-tier ordering process for task order
competition as described in Section C.2. Certified partners under NAICS codes
with $6 million or $12.5 million size standards will be allowed to compete on
requirements with a life cycle value equal to or less than $5 million (Tier I).
Partners with a size standard of $21 million or 500 employees will compete on
requirements with a life cycle value between $5 million and $70 million (Tier II).
Lastly, the 1500 employee category will only be allowed to compete for
requirements with a life cycle value at more than $70 million (Tier III). The only
exception to this proposed approach entails requirements that have an
incumbent contractor. Under this scenario the incumbent contractor would be
allowed to compete at any of the tier levels. The Government reserves the righ
o deviate from this ordering methodology if it is determined to be in the bes
interest of the Government.
The below graph illustrates the above process:

e. No work will be performed and no payment will be made except as authorized

and shall not be subject to the protest or disputes provisions of the contract,
except for a protest that the TO increases the scope, period, or maximum value
of the contract.

g. The Government intends to use electronic commerce methods to the
maximum extent practicable for TOs.
H.4 ANNUAL RE-CERTIFICATION
Each industry partner will be required to re-certify its status every 3 years (or in
accordance with SBA regulations) on the anniversary of the contract award. Partners
will be required to submit updated Section K – Representation and Certifications, prior to
he exercise of the third option year to remain eligible. The DOC recognizes the pending
SBA proposed rule, which requires annual recertification. Upon final ruling a change to
his solicitation and the contract will be incorporated.
H.5 ON/OFF RAMP
The Department intends to utilize an “On and Off Ramp” concept to manage the recertification process and maintain a sufficient pool of contract awardees at each size
category.
H.5.1 OFF RAMPS
“Off ramps” will be utilized when firms outgrow their size status and are no longer eligible
o receive new task orders within a specific size category and/or failed to propose on
ask order requirements. Firms that outgrow their size status will either “graduate” into
he next size category, or be removed from the contract entirely, if they do not recertify
in a size category. In addition, if a firm fails to participate on task order requirements the
government may not exercise its option. Lack of participation is defined as an industry
partner that does not respond to at least three requirements in a given year.
H.5.2 ON RAMPS
The Government reserves the right to conduct “on ramps” if it’s determined to be in the
best interest of the Government. “On ramps” will be used to obtain a new pool of viable
partners as off ramps are implemented. “On ramps” will ensure that new firms have an
opportunity to participate in the COMMITS NexGen and that program goals and
objectives are being met relative to fair opportunity practices. “On ramps” will involve
an open season and will be conducted no earlier than three years from date of award.
An open season will include publicizing a notice in the designated Government point of
entry, FedBizOps, stipulating requisite NAICS codes, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Sections L and M.
Contracts awarded under this open season provision will share in the ceiling of the
COMMITS NexGen program and their award shall not constitute a basis of contractual
adjustment for existing partners. Solicitation and any resulting contracts awarded under
his provision will include of the same terms and conditions of this contract and will no
exceed the remaining period of performance. The performance period will be set out in
he contracts awarded.

items or services.
H.9 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED ITEMS
All Government furnished items will be identified in the appropriate request for solutions
(RFS) and subsequent task order. If any given TO issued under this contract requires
work to be performed on the Government's site, the task order will provide the
Government Furnished Equipment or service (i.e., office work space, office automation
equipment, telecommunications and furniture for Contractor personnel). All GFE is
furnished “as is”.

he price or period of performance, it should notify the contracting officer of the changed
condition and submit a claim for equitable adjustment (see FAR 52.233-1).
Nothing in this clause abrogates the rights and responsibilities of the parties relating to
"stop work" provisions as cited in other sections of this contract.
H.11 INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF CONTRACTORS
The Department of Commerce (DOC) and/or other Government agencies may have
entered contractual agreements in order to provide information technology requirements
separate from the work to be performed under COMMITS NexGen TOs, yet having links

Section L
(f) Contract award.
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this
solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value
after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's
interest.
(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals
received.
(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract withou
discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).
Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cos
or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduc
discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in

additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.
(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or
counteroffer by the Government.
(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices
proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced
pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more
contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the
application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to
he Government.
(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source
selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the
successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding
contract without further action by either party.
(11) The Government may disclose the following information in postaward debriefings to
other offerors:
(i) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful offeror;
(ii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency
during source selection;
(iii) A summary of the rationale for award; and
(iv) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered
by the successful offeror.

L.11.2.2.1. Proposal Format and Submission.
Written Proposal and Associated Information
The Offeror shall submit the following:
Tab A-Transmittal Letter and SF-33
Tab B-Properly executed Section K Representations and Certifications
Tab C-Pricing for standard labor categories
Tab D-Proposal response detailing compliance with Mission Capability and Pas
Performance factors
Tab A - contains the transmittal letter and the SF-33 (see section A of the RFP). The
ransmittal letter formally transmits the offeror's proposal. This letter shall provide the
company's name, address, point of contact and point of contact's telephone number.
Also, this letter shall state the period of time that the offeror's proposal is valid. This
period of time shall not be less than 120 calendar days from the date for receipt of
proposals. The offeror shall also acknowledge all amendments under this solicitation in
either the transmittal letter or the SF-33. An official authorized to bind your company to
contractual agreements must sign both the SF-33 and transmittal letter.
Tab B – contains fully completed representation and certifications contained in Section
K.
Tab C – complete the pricing tables for designated standard labor categories using the
Government supplied format identified as Attachment J-6. This includes providing
proposed rates for each of the defined categories by base year plus four additional
option years for a total of five years.
The purpose of the pricing tables is to allow the Government to compare pricing among
all offerors. Accordingly, offerors must complete all required information using the
following instructions.
Complete Table A showing the hourly rate proposed for each of the five Governmen
identified standard labor categories and assume the work is performed for a Washington
DC location. Use the labor descriptions furnished for each category to determine which
of your company’s categories best matches the standard. If your company does no
provide this exact type of service, assume it is required for a task and provide the
service through a teaming partner or subcontractor you would normally use to
complement your own resources. In a similar manner complete hourly rates for all four
option years.
For purposes of pricing assume the base year starts on a contract award date of
January 1, 2004 and runs through December 31, 2004. Each option period follows the
same twelve-month cycle. Offerors are advised that the Service Contract Act applies to
his acquisition. For purposes of pricing, proposed rates must be in accordance with the
applicable Department of Labor Wage Determination (see Attachment J-7). Assume
hat the work is performed in the Washington, DC location.
Prices should be tied into an existing contract arrangement such as a GSA Schedule
contract or another GWAC. Separately identify the specific contract vehicle where the
prices are derived from including the applicable contract number. All proposed labor

Section L
rates must have been negotiated on a prior procurement within a year of the response to
his solicitation.
State the basis of any annual price escalation. If the escalation coincides with the terms
of an existing contract, state the conditions of that price increase.
Complete Table B in a similar manner except use annual rates. Assume 1800 hours in
one year. Include the corresponding annual amounts for each labor category and by
base and option years.
Finally add the total prices for each labor category for all five years under the right hand
column entitled “Total Price.” Then provide the total price for all five years and for all five
labor categories in the bottom right hand cell.
Tab D - should be organized to address all factors and subfactors described in Provision
M.3 of this solicitation entitled “Contract Award Evaluation Factors/Subfactors.” Within
both the Mission Capability and the Past Performance factors, address each of the
designated subfactors with narrative information showing how your company clearly
demonstrates compliance and support of the offeror’s claims. Cursory responses tha
merely reiterate the requirements are considered unacceptable. Demonstration of
experience, capability, and qualifications that clearly support compliance is required.
Under Mission Capability address the identified subfactors of use of innovative business
practices, experience in an ID/IQ environment, and team relationships with other
industry partners. In addition, offerors proposing under the 1500 employee size code
must provide the information for the mentoring experience subfactor.
Under Past Performance, address the identified subfactors of awards, past performance
management, and successful relationships with industry partners. For awards, state the
specific name of the award, date received, and a contact point that includes a name,
phone number and email address of the federal, state, local, or regional Governmen
organization granting the award. Clearly explain the significance of the award and the
distinction and reputation associated with it. Within the tab, include a copy of the award
or certification, followed by its corresponding Official Criteria. The Official Criteria
consist of the actual criteria used by the issuing organization to make the award. The
criteria must be from an official source (e.g., web site, memorandum, handbook, etc.). I
may be necessary for the Offeror to extract this information so that it can be included in
he proposal. However the copy of the actual award and the supporting information
does not count against any proposal page limitation. The Offeror must limit the
submission to just that dealing with the criteria.
The Government intends on evaluating past performance reference information obtained
during the Phase 1 evaluation. Offerors are not required to provide additional
information in that regard. The Government reserves the right to evaluate pas
performance reference information collected during Phase I in Phase 2. Cursory
responses that merely reiterate the requirements are considered unacceptable.
Demonstration of experience, capability, and qualifications that clearly suppor
compliance is required.

L.11.2.3 Oral Presentation
The government, solely at its option, may require offerors to also provide an oral
presentation of their response to this acquisition. If the government elects to do so, the
Contracting Officer will notify offerors and schedule the oral presentations with each
company. The Government will provide a minimum of seven working days notice to the
Offeror of the scheduled date and location. All oral presentations will take place in the
Washington, DC area.
a. In presenting, Offerors will be provided a total of one (1) hour. This includes
approximately 30 minutes to convey information to the Government. Offerors are
free to use the half hour time period in any manner they choose. It is strongly
recommended that Offerors take into consideration the relative order of
importance for section M evaluation criteria in planning their presentations. The
individual identified as the Offeror’s program manager will conduct the
presentation. Offerors are limited to seven (7) participants attending the session.
Offerors are responsible for providing any and all audio-visual equipmen
required for the presentation (e.g., overhead projector, screen, extension cords,
etc.) and 15 copies of the presentation for the Government. The Offeror will be
provided 30 minutes prior to the presentation for set up and familiarization with
he room characteristics.
b. There are no limitations or restrictions on the presentation material or media
other than the number of slides the presenter believes can realistically be
presented within the half hour period. Slides not discussed at the oral
presentations will be removed from the offeror's proposal and not considered by
he evaluators.

Solicitation No. CM1301-03-RP-0019

68

Section L
c. No price information shall be included in the presentation.
d. The Government does not intend to engage in discussions as defined by FAR
Part 15. After completion of the oral presentation, the Government may reques
clarification of any of the points addressed which were unclear and may ask for
elaboration. The responses are for clarification only and will not constitute
discussions. This will normally take no more than 30 minutes. The Governmen
will strive to ask clarifying questions at the end of the Offeror's presentation.
However should the Government need to ask questions in the middle of the
offeror’s presentation, time spent in responding by the Offeror will not coun
against its presentation time.
## RECOMMENDED PRESENTATION TOPICS
a. Introduction - Offeror's Program Manager and participants.
b. Mission Capability – The offeror shall identify innovative business practices,
highlight its experience working in an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contrac
environment, and describe teaming relationships with other Industry partners. In
addition, firms proposing only under the 1500 employees NAICS code shall describe
heir experiences mentoring other small businesses.
c. Past Performance - The Offeror shall describe any awards or certification(s)
received both relevant to work covered by the scope of COMMITS NexGen and timely.
The presentation should provide the Government with a clear understanding of the
significance of the award or certification and the distinction and reputation associated
with it. No awards will be considered that were achieved more than five years from the
date of the proposal submission. The Offeror should also describe its past performance
in managing complex information technology service efforts. The presentation should
focus on the management tools and techniques applied to previous efforts and the
results achieved. Special emphasis in the presentation should be placed on the Offeror
past performance on the application and use of performance and customer satisfaction
metrics.
L.12 QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATION OR INFORMATION
All questions and requests for RFP clarification or information are due by 3:00 p.m.,
September 26, 2003.
Only electronic submission of requests will be accepted. They shall be submitted to Ron
Ortega, Contracting Officer.
Should any request be received after the date and time stated above, the Governmen
reserves the right not to provide an answer. If, however, in the Government's opinion,
he question cites an issue of significant importance, the Government may provide
written responses to all offerors.
The Government will not provide any information concerning requests for clarifications in
response to telephone calls from Offerors. All questions and requests will be answered
electronically and provided to all Offerors at the COMMITS NexGen Internet site.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1 MULTIPLE AWARDS
The Government intends to award multiple contracts to a sufficient number of awardees
so that the following occurs: a) the full gamut of technical offerings, competence and
specialization contemplated within the broad range of COMMITS NexGen work is
adequately covered; b) a reasonable number of awards are made within each identified
NAICS code grouping and size status based on the governments overall anticipated
requirements over the life of the contract program; and c) all identified individual socioeconomic categories are adequately represented to the greatest extent practicable.
While no maximum number of contracts to be awarded has been determined, the
Government will keep the number of awards to a reasonable amount considering such
factors as:
(a) Maintaining a sufficient number of vendors to ensure adequate
competition for issuing task orders throughout COMMITS's NexGen ten
life,
(b) Avoiding unnecessary and burdensome contract administration, and
(c) Ensuring that winning contractors have the opportunity to receive a
meaningful amount of task order work.
M.2 BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD
a. The contract award decisions will be based on the Government's evaluation of each
Offeror's complete proposal submission (and oral presentation if applicable) with respec
o the following:
(1) Offerors not responding to any one or more of the factors or subfactors identified in this solicitation shall be disqualified from further
consideration.
(2) The Government's evaluation of the first two selection factors (i.e.,
Mission Capability and Past Performance) shall be accomplished
separately from the evaluation of the Offeror's pricing.
b. The source evaluation will be based on a "Best Value Analysis." Accordingly,
award(s) will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable Offeror(s) whose
proposal(s) (including information from the oral presentation) provides the greates
overall value to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Best value for
he purpose of COMMITS NexGen, means the expected outcome of an acquisition that,
in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the
requirement. In making this evaluation, the Government is more concerned with
obtaining superior management and technical skills than with making award(s) to the
Offeror(s) with the lowest labor prices.

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

70

Section M
c. When conducting the evaluations, the Government will use data provided by the
Offeror in the proposal, the optional oral presentation, as well as data obtained from
other sources. While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other
sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete information rests with the
Offeror.
d. The quality of the Offeror's response and adherence to solicitation requirements
and/or restrictions will be considered reflective of the manner in which the Offeror could
be expected to perform COMMITS NexGen tasks and will be considered in the
evaluation process. Information furnished by Offerors beyond stated page and oral
presentation time limitations shall not be considered.
e. The Government anticipates award without discussion.
M.3 CONTRACT AWARD EVALUATION FACTORS/SUBFACTORS
A major objective of COMMITS NexGen is to provide opportunities for the total small
business community to meet the Government’s information technology needs. However,
one readily apparent fact is that a wide range of knowledge, experience, abilities, and
capabilities exist throughout the universe of small businesses. Under this acquisition for
example, firms range in size from the very small to much larger firms. It is unrealistic to
expect that the smaller firms have the same depth and breadth of resources as well as
experience and capabilities as the larger ones. In order to provide a more equitable
means of proposal evaluation and to ensure a representative distribution of contrac
awards to small firms of varying sizes, the Government will utilize varying standards in
he proposal evaluation process. While the same technical criteria apply to all offerors,
he standards with respect to each evaluation factor/subfactor will become comparatively
more stringent as the size category grows.
Offerors also will be evaluated on their stand-alone capabilities for initial award of the
contract. While companies ultimately receiving contract awards are free to team and
subcontract with other partners to compete for and perform on specific task orders, this
evaluation for contract award will consider only the offerors qualifications and
experience. The very broad scope of work covered by this acquisition does not lend
itself to evaluating teaming arrangements or subcontractor agreements. Rather, specific
partner capabilities will be evaluated subsequent to contract award at the time task
orders are being proposed against. However the ability of an offeror to recruit, retain and
work closely with other entities in any form of teaming arrangement that provides specific
solutions to agency needs is important along with their record of past performance.
Consequently the ability to work jointly with other entities, with a degree of demonstrated
success, is a key part of the evaluation.
M.3.1 MISSION CAPABILITY
The Offeror’s approach to managing performance will be a subjective assessment based
on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. A total of three subfactors
comprise this factor except that a fourth subfactor of mentoring applies to offerors who
propose under a 1500 employee size standard. Subfactors are of approximately equal
importance with each other.

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

71

Section M
Sub-Factors:
1. Use of innovative business practices
The government will evaluate the quality, completeness,
responsiveness, relevance, and credibility of innovative business
practices employed by the offeror. Such innovations improve business
operations on a continuous basis and are designed to enhance contrac
performance, increase the likelihood that desired contractual outcomes
are achieved, utilize metrics to set goals and monitor performance, and
reduce overall costs. The government will look at the types of
innovative practices the offeror currently employ including the use of
performance based contracting.
2. Experience in ID/IQ environmen
The government will examine the offeror’s experience in an Indefinite
Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracting environment. ID/IQ
contracts include working on a wide variety of complex tasks for multifunctional information technology projects on a simultaneous basis and
at different locations and often on a quick reaction basis.
3. Team arrangements with other Industry Entities
The ability to obtain required resources for performance of tasks and
working in a team arrangement with a number of other industry entities
will be evaluated. This includes the ability to manage and staff a variety
of tasks through teaming, partnering and subcontracting. Furthermore i
includes the ability to recruit and retain entities as well as managing and
integrating the efforts of the entire team.
4. Mentoring experience (applicable only to 1500 employee NAICS code)
Experience in mentoring other small firms so that they can ultimately
compete successfully for and subsequently perform governmen
contracts on their own will be evaluated. The degree to which offerors
provide technical, managerial, financial and other types of assistance to
aid developing smaller businesses is a prime consideration. Special
emphasis is placed on mentor designations as part of formal
government “Mentor-Protégé Programs”.
M.3.1.2 PAST PERFORMANCE
The evaluation of the quality of the Offeror’s past performance is a subjective
assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.
Subfactors are of equal importance with each other.

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

72

Section M
Sub-Factors
1. Awards
The Government will evaluate the quality of the award and certification
received by the Offeror. This includes an examination of the relevancy
and currency of the award and certification. Relevancy refers to how
applicable the award and certification are to the work contemplated by
COMMITS NexGen as well as the character. Currency addresses the
date the award or certification was received (see Section L).
Evaluation weight is given for federal, state, local and regional awards
and certifications (e.g., the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award,
ISO 9000 series, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering
Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Level, etc.) While important, local or
regional awards are not as significant. In addition self-certification, as
opposed to independent reviews and certifications, is not meaningful
and will receive no consideration in the evaluation.
2. Past performance managemen
The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s past performance in
management of complex information technology service efforts. This
focuses on the management tools and techniques applied to previous
efforts and the results achieved. Special emphasis is placed on the
application and use of performance and customer satisfaction metrics.
3. Successful relationships with Industry Entities
The Government will examine the offerors ability to maintain a
successful relationship with prior partners. This includes evidence tha
mutual goals were accomplished, high quality services were provided
where shared responsibilities in fulfilling the customer’s objectives
existed, and ultimate customer satisfaction resulted. Offerors record of
establishing successful relationships in both depth and breadth with
other partners is paramount.
M.3.2 PRICE
Price proposals will be evaluated for realism and reasonableness. Rates for
work in the Washington, DC area will be examined to determine if they deviate
above or below what is expected. If prices are excessively low or unrealistically
high such information will indicate a lack of understanding of the requirements. A
designated sample of rates will also be compared against those of other offerors
o determine if they are reasonable.
M.3.3 RELEVANCY OF IMPORTANCE FACTORS

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

73

Section M
Within Non-Price Factors, Factor 1 (Mission Capability) is of equal importance
with Non-Price Factor 2 (Past Performance). Each of the Non-Price Factors is
more important than the Price Factor. Together the Non-Price Factors are
significantly more important than the Price Factor (FAR 15.304(e)).

COMMITS NexGen Fair Opportunity Competitive Procedures
In accordance with FAR 16.505, the fair opportunity to be considered competitive
procedures for the COMMITS program is provided below.
As an overview, the basic COMMITS fair opportunity competitive process begins when
an information technology need is identified. A performance based (when appropriate)
Statement of Requirements (SOR), with source selection criteria is prepared.
Additionally, the requiring agency and COMMITS program office define the roles and
responsibilities of the government parties in a task order management plan. The SOR is
offered to the appropriate COMMITS contract holders to determine if they wish to submi
a task order proposal. The requesting activity evaluates the submitted task order
proposals, and based on an evaluation of the proposal against the previously developed
evaluation criteria, the delivery order is awarded to the ‘best value” contractor.
In the event the Department of Commerce delegates ordering authority through this
vehicle, the ordering agency must abide by the Department of Commerce ordering
procedures.
The following process represents general guidelines. The process for each effort can be
ailored to fit the needs of the customer.
Step 1:

Identify Need
Identifying the need for information technology solutions is the first step in the
COMMITS process. This task is the responsibility of the requiring activity
(the customer). If an activity recognizes the need for information technology
solutions, they should first contact the COMMITS program office. The
program office will provide guidance and instructions on the use of the
COMMITS contracts. The program office will, if needed, assist with the
development of the full Statement of Requirements, and provide the
necessary resources to fully describe the technical requirements of the task,
o ensure successful competition and award of the delivery order. During this
step the reimbursable charge to non-DOC customers will be discussed. The
charge will be tailored to fit the amount of effort the customer requires of the
COMMITS office to satisfy their requirement.

Step 2:

Address Scope Issues, if any
This is the responsibility of the COMMITS Program Office, in conjunction with
he COMMITS Contracting Office. This step is necessary to ensure that the
anticipated requirements are within the scope of the COMMITS contracts.
While this step is necessary, given the scope of work envisioned by the basic
contracts, and the solution based structure, it is anticipated that only

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

76

Attachment J-1
requirements that do not in some manner call for information technology
would be considered outside the scope of the COMMITS contract.
Step 3:

Prepare Statement of Requirement (SOR), Source Selection Criteria, and
Task Order Management Plan
As the title implies, the Statement of Requirements presents the requesting
activities requirements. It is this document, along with the source selection
criteria, that contractors will use to prepare proposals for evaluation. The
SOR is the most important document in the process. The SOR must fully
detail the entire requirement, as that will be the primary source of information
used by the contractors to prepare their proposals. The SOR should not jus
be limited to technical details: logistics requirements, data deliverables,
special instructions or conditions should also be described. For information
echnology services, it is important that the SOR be written as a performance
based requirement. Preparation of the SOR and the source selection criteria
is the responsibility of the requiring activity unless the activity requests
COMMITS program office support.
Following the solution based structure, the COMMITS contracts have no
contract pricing. This gives contractors the latitude to propose various
solutions which that they feel will give the best value to the Government, a
he time of requirement. Requesting activities are encouraged to perform
market research in drafting the SOR. This could include seeking and
receiving input or suggestions from the COMMITS contractors as well as
other sources. However, COMMITS contractors are prohibited from
preparing Statements of Requirements.
Preparation of the Source Selection Criteria will also be accomplished by the
requiring activity. These criteria may be different for each SOR, but may
include Price, Technical Solution, Management Approach, Past Performance
and/or Small Business Participation.
In addition to identifying the evaluation criteria, the requesting activity can
further identify the functional area, and category they wish for the fair
opportunity competition to take place. For example, the nature of the
requirement should identify which functional area would be best to request a
solution, e.g., Information System Security Support Services. Within the
functional area, the requesting activity can further identify the category (i.e.,
small, small disadvantaged, small disadvantaged 8(a), or small womenowned business) they want the competition to be conducted. This allows the
requesting activity to select and receive acquisition credit based on the
selected category’s status.

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

77

Attachment J-1
Finally, the requesting activity with assistance of the COMMITS program
office will develop a task order management plan. This plan will identify the
specific responsibilities of each party in performing contract administration
functions. The plan will further serve as a statement of work for any efforts to
be performed by the COMMITS program office.

Step 4:

Release Statement of Requirements via Internet
In keeping with the COMMITS program office’s intent to minimize the flow of
paper, the requiring activity will send the completed SORs and source
selection evaluation criteria to the COMMITS program office for electronic
release to COMMITS contractors. The COMMITS program office will use the
COMMITS website for release of the SOR, source selection criteria, and
other instructions to the COMMITS contractors.
Each SOR will be offered to the identified COMMITS category contractors in
accordance with the requirement for fair opportunity to be considered as
described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b). The
COMMITS program office cannot direct an award to a specific COMMTS
contractor unless one of four exemptions in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. These
exemptions are:
1. The agency’s need for such supplies or services is of such urgency
hat providing such an opportunity would result in unacceptable
delays.
2. Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or
services required at the level of quality required because the supplies
or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.
3. The order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of
economy and efficiency as logical follow-on to an order already issued
under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair
opportunity to be considered for the original order.
4. Necessary to satisfy a minimum order.

Step 5:

Respond to SOR
After release of the SOR via the Internet, those contractors interested in
submitting a proposal will provide detailed proposals in accordance with the
suspense date provided and await Government evaluation.

Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019

78

Attachment J-1
In crafting solutions to specific task order requirements, the COMMITS
contractors will have access to the General Services Administration’s (GSA)
Federal Supply Schedules (FSS). The Government will authorize the
COMMITS contractors to use the FSS contracts to take advantage of the
significant quantity discounts available to the Government. Small businesses
may not be able to match the Government’s buying power or achieve similar
discounts. It is in the best interest of the Government to allow COMMITS
contractors the opportunity to use the FSS contracts for each proposed task
order solution.

Step 6:

Evaluate Responses to SOR
Proposal evaluation will be conducted by the requiring activity. The
COMMITS program office can assist in the evaluation as necessary. Each
evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the established evaluation
criteria. The requiring activity is responsible for selecting the best value
contractor. An evaluation report will be provided to the COMMITS program
office with the results of the evaluation.

Step 7:

Award Task Order
If award authority has been delegated, the requiring activity places the task
order with the selected contractors. Copies of the task order will be provided
o the COMMITS program office.
If award authority remains with the COMMITS contracting officer, the
requesting activity forwards their appropriate funding document, to the
COMMITS program office. Based on the selection decision, the COMMITS
contracting officer will award the task order to the successful contractor.
Successful offerors will be notified and arrangements will be made for work to
begin. In either case, the funding agency will receive award credit for the
category of business selected (i.e., small, small disadvantaged, small
disadvantaged 8(a), and small women-owned).

Step 8:

Execute Task Order
Unless the agency requests COMMITS program office support, the
responsibility for managing the delivery order resides with the requiring
activity. The requiring activity’s responsibilities will be spelled out in the task
management plan. At a minimum, the requiring activity will be responsible for
completing past performance reports which will be sent the contractor for
comment and then to the COMMIT program office. These performance
reports will be maintained in a past performance database, to be used for
future task order evaluations, and general reporting requirements.

Step 9:

Acceptance of Product and/or Service.
When the work is completed, the requiring activity accepts the products and
services via the appropriate acceptance document.

AGENCY PROTEST PROCEDURES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AGENCY-LEVEL PROTEST
PROCEDURES LEVEL ABOVE THE CONTRACTING OFFICER (DEC 1996)
I. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No.
12979 which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to
awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the contracting officer. Authority to
administer procurement-related directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the
Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Managemen
(Procurement Executive).
The Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build
confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and
other external fora. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve
concerns raised by an interested party at the contracting officer level through open and frank discussions. If
concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the
agency at a level above the contracting officer.
II. DEFINITIONS:
An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority
but not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority,
he guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer
apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102.
A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which
he period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal
holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when
he Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period
extends to the next day on which the Department is open.
III. PROCEDURES:
a. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final
decision for the Department. Protests shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer.
"The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agencylevel Protest." The protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the
responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below:
Contract Law DivisionOffice of the Assistant General Counsel for Finance and LitigationDepartment of
Commerce, Room H588214th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20230FAX: 202482-5858
b. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the
protester agrees not to protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) or any other external fora. If the
protester has already filed with the GAO or other external fora, the procedures described here may not be
used.

Attachment J-5
1. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid
opening or time set for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for
receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days
after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be
debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two
sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or
should have been known, whichever is earlier.
2. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Any
protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete
submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided.
3. To be complete, protests must contain the following information:
(i) the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number
(ii) the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer
(iii) a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how
he protester was prejudiced
(iv) copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statemen
(v) a request for ruling by the agency
(vi) statement as to form of relief requested
(vii) all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a
protes
(viii) all information establishing the timeliness of the protes
All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester.
Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer will prepare an administrative report tha
responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the
protester, have been identified by agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement process.
For good cause shown, the protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the
administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision
authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within 1 day of the decision to grant the extension.
Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest.
The protest decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subjec
o further appeals.
The protest decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to
he protester by certified mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting
office and Office of Acquisition Management.
Effect of protest on award and performance:
When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the
Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that:
Solicitation No. 1301-03-RP-0019
89

Attachment J-5
(i) The supplies or services are urgently required, (ii) delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by
failure to make the award promptly, or (iii) a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government.
When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the
protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.1004, whichever is later, the contracting
officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency,
including any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA
may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that:
(i) contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or (ii) urgent and compelling
circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision.
IV. REMEDIES:
The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies:
(1) terminate the contract,
(2) re-compete the requirement,
(3) issue a new solicitation,
(4) refrain from exercising options under the contract,
(5) award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations,
(6) amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue
with the procurement,
(7) such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to
correct a defec

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contrac
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by
he contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}

should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

occupation) and computes a proposed rate).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
hat duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

HELPFUL HINTS:
Because service IDIQ contracts may include many different tasks under
heir scope, it is recommended that there be language in the actual IDIQ
PWS that states performance based task orders may be issued agains
he contract. Included in any performance based task orders will be
measures and a quality assurance surveillance plan. The proposed
measures and metrics would be used as the basis of comparison in
evaluating technical proposals.
