## STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1. BACKGROUND
As part of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) E-Government initiative
Business Partner Network (BPN) business area provides web-enabled services for
identifying Federal and industry trading partners.
The Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is a BPN business
area web-based service that centralizes the collection and distribution of vendor
representations and certifications of business information required for contract award. I
supports contractor evaluation and replaces most FAR level provisions found in Section
K of a solicitation. ORCA requirements were presented and discussed by the BPN
Working Group that consists of representatives from the DoD and Federal Government.
Development of the system began in August 2002. The Pilot Program, which included
representatives from Department of Interior’s National Business Center, Navy
Management Logistics Command, and U.S. Coast Guard, commenced in late October
2002. ORCA was in production after the pilot program concluded and the first users of
he system were Architect-Engineering (A-E) firms. The Army Corp of Engineers pu
out a notice stating Firms interested in architect-engineer contracts with the Federal
government can voluntarily enter general qualifications required by Standard Form 330,
Part II through ORCA. The A-E firms started registering in June 2004.
FAC 01-26, containing the Federal mandate requiring the use of ORCA was published on
December 20, 2004. The mandate is located in 52.204-8 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR). The implementation date of this mandate was January 1, 2005.
2. PURPOSE
The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the ORCA with engineering services and
program management services to maintain and improve the application. The efforts
include successful integration into DoD and Federal contracting writing systems, finance,
and business systems; and creative use of the data to assist additional DoD and Federal
missions and business process transformation. The offeror also ensures that requirements
are properly allocated to the respective systems, the implementation plans are
coordinated, and that the development effort results in appropriate integration among the
systems and their supporting infrastructure.
3. SCOPE
The scope of this effort is to provide program management, development, maintenance,
integration, testing, training, functional, security, and technical operation support of
ORCA. The contractor shall perform activities that include system engineering,
integration, software development, system architecture and engineering support, system
and database maintenance, system test and evaluation, system and database
documentation, and enhancement encapsulation. The contractor shall analyze, plan,

1

design, document, develop, integrate, test, implement, operate, validate, enhance, support,
manage, and maintain a robust system, to include but not limited to all necessary labor,
materials, supplies, hardware, and software that will provide comprehensive program
management and technical capabilities of ORCA. In addition, the contractor shall
support agency or program unique requirements. The offeror shall propose how to
accomplish system transition without service interruption in the offeror’s System
Transition Plan. The offeror shall submit the proposed System Transition Plan with the
offeror’s Technical Proposal and Performance Work Statement (PWS). The offeror’s
response shall include proposals with and without hosting services for the ORCA, and
different levels of COOP support (real-time, hot, warm, cold).

5. INCENTIVES
The offeror shall propose an incentive plan including minimum and maximum percentage
performance incentive fees and performance-measuring metrics. The incentive plan shall
include the action taken for the work that exceeds the standards (positive incentives) and
for the work that does not meet standards (negative incentives). The definitions of
maximum positive and negative performance incentives, and the units of measuremen
shall be strongly defined. The incentive plan will be readdressed annually to ensure tha
he set incentives are actually encouraging good performance and discouraging
unsatisfactory performance.
6. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
This task shall be performed primarily at the contractor’s site. Local travel will be
required from the contractor’s site to Business Transformation Agency (BTA)/DISA
locations and IAE offices in Crystal City and Washington, DC. The contractor shall
request for COR’s approval prior to all long distance travel.
7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The contract will be awarded for base period of one year. Based on contractor
performance, four one-year options may be granted. The total term of the contract will
not exceed 5 years. The period of performance begins on task order award for one year.
All days referenced in this SOO are calendar days.
8. CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
The COTR will assist in monitoring the Contractor’s performance in accordance with the
designation memorandum. A detailed description of their duties and limitations will be
defined in their designation memorandum. A copy of the designation letter will be kep
with the official contract file. Performance will be evaluated and recorded on an annual
basis unless otherwise required.
The ORCA Program Manager/COTR monitors contractor performance both formally and
informally. Formal monitoring includes bi-weekly meetings of an Information Review
Board that reviews major aspects of system operations over the past two weeks. Informal
monitoring includes an almost constant exchange of messages, questions, and answers
about system development, testing, operations, and maintenance. The ORCA PM
maintains and reports metrics to the system functional owners.

12. SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE SPECIFICATION
(1) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal
agencies acquiring Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) to ensure that Federal
employees and members of the public with disabilities have access to and use of
information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who
are not individuals with disabilities.
(2) All EIT procured under this contract/order must meet the following 36 CFR 1194
accessibility standards and associated provisions at the time of delivery to the
Government. The full text of the accessibility standards is available at:
http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=content&ID=12

- Section 1194.21 – Software Applications and
Operating Systems.
- Section 1194.22 – Web Based Intranet and
Internet Information and Applications.
- Section 1194.23 – Telecommunications Products.
- Section 1194.24 – Video and Multimedia
Products.
- Section 1194.25 – Self-Contained, Closed
Products.
- Section 1194.26 – Desktop and Portable
Computers.
- Section 1194.31 – Functional Performance
Criteria.
- Section 1194.41 – Information, Documentation
and Support.

9

(3) The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software
or the attachment of an assistive technology devise(s), but merely require that the EIT be
compatible with such software and device(s) so that it can be made accessible if so
required in the future.
(4) Contractors may propose products or services that use designs or technologies that do
not meet the applicable necessary standards but provide substantially equivalent or
greater access to use of a product by individuals with disabilities; this is known as
equivalent facilitation (see 36 CFR Section 1194.5). Such offers/quotes will be
considered to have met the provisions of the accessibility standards for the feature or
component providing equivalent facilitation.
(e) Contractors offering less than fully Section 508 compliant EIT must clearly identify in
heir proposal/quote any EIT that is not fully compliant and identify the Section 508
accessibility standard(s), or specific provisions of the standard(s), set forth in the
solicitation that will not be met in time to meet the Government’s stated
delivery/performance schedule. Unless otherwise stated in the proposal/quote, the
contractor represents that the EIT supplies and/services offered fully comply with the
accessibility standard(s) set forth in the solicitation.”
