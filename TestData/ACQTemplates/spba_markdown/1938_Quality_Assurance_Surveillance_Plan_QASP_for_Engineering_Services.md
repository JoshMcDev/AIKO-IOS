Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
for the Engineering and Technical Services Effor
for Identification Systems

1.

Purpose

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used
o make sure the systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the performance
based service order. The intent is to ensure that the contractor performs in accordance with the
performance metrics and the Government receives the quality of services called for in the order.
This contract requirement is to provide engineering and technical services for the Identification Systems
(IDS) Division. Specifically, the contractor shall support the Government in research and analysis,
performance analysis and design engineering, test bed design and development, system test and evaluation,
interface engineering, system integration engineering, installation and checkout planning, field engineering
and technical support, engineering documentation and training services. The resulting vehicle will be an
order under the Seaport-e multiple award contract. The performance based order will have cost plus fixed
fee labor CLINs. The order will be for a base year with four option years. A properly executed QASP will
assist the Government in achieving the objectives of this procurement.
2.

Authority

Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E – Inspection and Acceptance,
which provides for inspections and acceptance of the services and documentation called for in service
contracts, to be executed by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized representative.
3.

Scope

To fully understand the roles and responsibilities of the parties, it is important to first define the distinction
in terminology between Quality Control Plan and the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. Within a
Quality Control Plan, the contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality
control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the order.
The QASP on the other hand, is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the
contractor’s efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the
order.
4.

Government Resources

The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan:
Contracting Officer - A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into (Procuring Contracting
Officer (PCO)) or administer (Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO)) contracts and make related
determination and findings on behalf of the Government. The PCO for this contract is Mr. J. Larry.
Mattingly, 2.5.1.2. The ACO will be designated in the resulting order. Contracting Officers are designated
via a written warrant, which sets forth limitations of authority.
Task Order Manager (TOM) - An individual appointed in writing by the PCO to act as their authorized
representative to assist in administering the contract. The TOM will be appointed in the resulting task
order. The limitations of authority are contained in a written letter of appointment.
Government Project Leads – The TOM designates an individual Government Project Lead to assist in
administering a specific project under the contract.

Attachment 1
Enclosure (1)

5.

Responsibilities

The following Government resources shall have responsibility for the implementation of this QASP:
Contracting Officer – The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective
contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United
States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the Contractor receives
impartial, fair and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible
for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor’s performance.
Task Order Manager – The TOM is responsible for technical administration of the contract and assures
proper Government surveillance of the contractor’s performance. The TOM is not empowered to make any
contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Government’s behalf. Any changes that the
contractor deems may affect contract price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer
for action.
Government Project Leads – The Government Project Lead is responsible for assisting in administering a
specific project under the contract. A Government Project Lead cannot, in any manner, alter the scope of
he contract, make commitments or authorize any changes on the Government’s behalf
6.

Methods of QA Surveillance

a.

Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS) – The market place for engineering
and technical services is very competitive. As such, the successful offeror has a vested interest in the
Government generated CPARS under this contract. Additionally, an evaluation using the CPARS
format will be performed at the end of each year of performance. This evaluation will be one
determinant in exercising an option. The Government for this procurement will address the quality of
product or service, schedule, cost control, business relations, management, and other important areas.
As this information may affect future source selections throughout DoD, and the continuation of the
order, the annual Government assessment will be used appropriately as an additional performance
oversight and communication tool with the QASP.

b.

QASP - The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used by the TOM and Government Project
Leads in the technical administration of this QASP. In addition to the below instructions, the form to
be used for documentation of quality assurance surveillance is the Surveillance Activity Checklis
provided herein.

7.
Surveillance
Enclosures (1) and (2) set forth the performance standards, incentives, and surveillance methods for the
contractor and Government Project Leads while enclosure (3) provides the checklist and means for the
TOM to document on a quarterly basis the results of the surveillance and shall be provided to the
Contracting Officer on a quarterly basis.
8.
Documentation
In addition to providing quarterly reports to the Contracting Officer, the TOM will maintain a complete
Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any
actions related to the Government’s performance of the quality assurance function, including the originals
of the Quality Assurance Checklists. All such records will be maintained for the life of the order. The
TOM shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the order.

All PWS/CDRL tasks, including PWS/CDRL sub-tasks, will be assessed focusing on the following.
Quality of Product or Service – Assess the contractor’s effort to transform operational needs and
requirements into an integrated solution. Areas of focus may include the planning and management of
program tasks, the quality of support provided throughout all phases of contract execution, the integration
of program management specialties, management of interfaces, and the management of a totally integrated
effort of all program management concerns to meet cost, performance, and schedule objectives. Assess how
successfully the contractor meets program quality.
Schedule – Assess the contractor’s adherence to the required delivery schedule by assessing the
contractor’s efforts during the assessment period that contribute to or effect the schedule variance. Also

Attachment 1
Enclosure (2)

address significance of scheduled events (i.e., design reviews), discuss causes, and assess the effectiveness
of contractor corrective actions.
Cost Control – Assess the contractor’s effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost.
Is the contractor experiencing cost growth or underrun? If so, discuss the causes and contractor-proposed
solutions for the cost overruns. For contracts where task or contract sizing is based upon contractor
provided person-hour estimates, the relationship of these estimates to ultimate cost should be assessed. In
addition, the extent to which the contractor demonstrates a sense of cost responsibility, through the efficien
use of resources in each work effort should be assessed.
Business Relations – Assess the timelines, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective
action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor’s reasonable and cooperative behavior, effective business
relations, and customer satisfaction.
Management – Assess the contractor’s success with timely award and management of subcontracts,
including whether the contractor met small/small disadvantage and women-owned business participation
goals. Discuss the extent to which the contractor discharges its responsibility for integration and
coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract; identifies and applies resources required to mee
schedule requirements; assigns responsibility for tasks/actions required by contract; communicates
appropriate information to affected program elements in a timely manner. Assess the contractor’s risk
mitigation plans. If applicable, identify any other management areas that are unique to the contract.
Other areas – Assess additional evaluation areas unique to the contract or that cannot be captured
elsewhere.

The evaluation ratings are as follows:
Exceptional – Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government’s benefit.
The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed was accomplished with few minor
problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.
Very Good - Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government’s benefit.
The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed was accomplished with some minor
problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.
Satisfactory - Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the task and
sub-task contain some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were
satisfactory.
Marginal - Performance does not meet contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the task
and sub-task being assessed reflect a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified
corrective actions. The contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully
implemented.
Unsatisfactory – Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a
imely manner. The contractual performance of the task or sub-task contains a serious problem(s) for
which the contractor’s actions appear or were ineffective.
