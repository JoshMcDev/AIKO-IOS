SECTION C - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)
UNIFIED EXPORT STRATEGY (UES) SYSTEM UPGRADE (V.2.0)
C.1.1. Introduction and Background
C.1.2. Introduction
The Information Technology Division is responsible for the design and maintenance of
information technology (IT) requirements to support the Agency’s headquarters and international
operations. The FAS’ IT infrastructure supports approximately 550 users in Washington, D.C.,
and 450 users in 90 overseas locations.
The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks a
qualified contractor to develop and implement an upgrade to the Unified Export Strategy System
(UES). The goal of the upgrade effort is to replace the legacy system, consisting of dual Sybase
databases and active-server-page front-end, with a modernized system, consisting of a single
SQL-server database, web-enabled .Net front-end in a firewall protected environment, following
a low-risk phased migration approach.
C.1.3. Background
The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) works to
improve foreign market access for U.S. products. The FAS operates programs designed to build
new markets and improve the competitive position of U.S. agriculture in the global marketplace.
FAS bears the primary responsibility for USDA’s overseas activities—market development,
international trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection and analysis of statistics and
market information. FAS also administers USDA’s export credit guarantee and food aid
programs and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing
expertise for agriculturally led economic growth.
The data and information in the Unified Export Strategy (UES) system is vital to all FAS
program areas. During the 10 years since its original deployment, the UES system has expanded
in scope, functionality, and user base. It is the primary source of industry input used by FAS
staff, by Senior Executives in all of the Agency's program areas, by the Administrator, and
ultimately by the Under Secretary and Secretary in making key decisions for prioritizing and
allocating funds and staff resources for the programs and initiatives.
FAS has the responsibility of managing marketing programs that promote US agricultural
commodities to foreign markets. FAS administers program funding to USDA industry partners,
or cooperators, who submit online strategic and tactical marketing plans via the UES system.
FAS staff will review the plans and allocate budgets that are tracked in the UES system.
Cooperators will execute their plans and request advances and reimbursements for their activities
from within the UES system. FAS will approve the requests and produce payment vouchers in
he UES system. Cooperators will report on actual results in the UES system.

The stakeholders of the UES system belong to the following groups:
1. Cooperators/Participants (outside industry partners, trade associations)
2. FAS Marketing Specialist (Governments employees who review and evaluate
marketing information)
3. Program Policy Staff (PPS), Grants Management Branch (GM) (Governmen
employees who handle funding, accounting systems and finance)
4. FAS Overseas Attaché Offices (Posts)
5. FAS Upper Management*
* To be combined with Group 2
FAS Headquarters has approximately 600 employees located in the USDA South Building,
Portals Building, and Reporters Building in Washington DC. FAS has approximately 90 offices
around the world with 1 to 20 employees in each office, and 3 regional hub-sites to support email
located in Brussels, Tokyo, and Buenos Aires.
C.1.4. FAS UES Legacy System
FAS currently has a legacy information technology (IT) system to help manage the UES
activities. The front end code is Active Server pages written in Visual Basic script or a visual
basic executable. The back end code is Transact-SQL. The user interface accepts tex
information and stores it in a backend database.
In recent years, as advances in technology have overtaken the current system, the number and
severity of UES shortcomings have grown. As a result, the USDA/FAS is in urgent need of
upgrading the UES system to improve operational efficiency, planning and coordination,
analysis of effectiveness, and performance measurement. FAS is, therefore, embarking on a
program to upgrade the UES system, with the twin goals of maximizing improvements in system
performance and utility to stakeholders while minimizing disruption to current users.

______________________________________________________________________________

C.1.5. Scope
The primary goal of the UES system upgrade is to migrate the back end and the front end, add
useful enhancements and to consolidate information into one single web-based interface for all
UES users, using prevalent technology including Microsoft SQL server, web-enabled .Net frontend and Microsoft reporting services. All the users will log into a new integrated information
system through which FAS will manage and administer its marketing programs and interact with
its cooperators. All users will login from outside the FAS firewall, and will have equal access to
information . The single interface will configure according to the users’ role and permissions.
Figure-1 shows a conceptual diagram of the upgraded system environment. Implementation of
he upgraded system, as an evolvement from the existing legacy system, will include the
following modular migrations and enhancements:
1. Database: Migrate from Sybase database technology to Microsoft SQL-Server
echnology, implement a semantic layer in Microsoft reporting services for ad-hoc
reporting.
2. Front-end: Replace the existing front-end code with web-enabled .Net code which is a
single configurable application
3. Implement new enhancements:
a. User interface allowing graphic charts and word-processing-like editing in
addition to tex
b. Integrate Ad-hoc reporting to include Business Intelligence (BI) capability
(Microsoft Reporting Services)
c. Collaboration tools
d. Others
These migrations/enhancements are to be implemented for different UES functions and
applications. During the migration period, the UES should be able to continue to offer its
functionality to its users. Appendix-A provides one “example” of mapping between the UES
legacy “As-Is” elements with the UES upgraded “To-Be” elements. FAS does not provide any
assurances that this mapping will work. After contract award, the Contractor will undertake a
“discovery” task to generate a complete mapping between the “As-Is” and “To-Be” elements.
The UES upgrade should follow a well-conceived phased migration path, with incremental
implementation/replacements and milestone-based deliverables, so that users can enjoy the
benefit of the upgrade features before the completion of the entire system. FAS plans to adopt a
performance-based contract structure such that the milestone-based deliverables can be
monitored, measured and assessed against a well-defined set of performance metrics at discrete
stages of the system development life cycle.
The UES project has been historically divided into three stages (Stages I to III), the first two of
which are complete. In Stage I, a “Needs Assessment” was conducted, which concluded that a
major upgrade of the UES system was needed. Based on the needs assessment, Stage II was
carried out to develop the “Requirements” for the upgraded system.

The deliverables of Stage-II, and other supporting documents, are listed in Section 6.2
(Supporting Documents). These documents provide a comprehensive description of the planned
UES and can serve as baseline for contractors to develop their technical approaches and cos
estimates.
Stage III represents the essence of the current effort, which will involve acceptance of the
requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment of the UES upgrade in the FAS
production environment, including creating user and system documentation and conducting user
raining and user acceptance testing.

C.1.6. Program Objectives for UES Upgrade
The overriding objective of FAS is to obtain the best fully operational Web-based solution tha
meets the functionality of the upgraded UES as outlined in the Requirements documents. The
proposed solution should provide an upgraded and enhanced system, seamless migration of
legacy database data and database objects (including the database objects that implement the
accounting systems), and integrated reporting capabilities, including ad-hoc reporting.
The specific program objectives are described below:
(1).
Confirm the UES Requirements: The contractor will conduct a complete review and
analysis of the Requirements documents and functions of the legacy system, and formally accep
hat the requirements are correct, complete and consistent or propose any necessary changes to
he requirements baseline.
(2).
Compliance with Federal Requirements: The contractor will ensure that the upgraded
system will comply with all relevant Federal and USDA government requirements and
guidelines, including Enterprise Architecture, security, privacy, disaster recovery, and others, as
stipulated in Section 5 (Constraints) of this document.
(3).
Upgrade the UES in segments: The development of UES will be implemented in
segments. The contractor is requested to formulate an optimal, low-risk, incremental
implementation plan , offering milestone-based demonstrable deliverables for each segment. The
contractor should demonstrate how it would implement (deliver, integrate, and deploy) the
configured solution. During the course of the effort, FAS will expect partial deliverables to be
deployed that work seamlessly with legacy components that remain to be upgraded. At the end of
he project, FAS expects a fully configured, operable, and deployed system that completely
complies with the UES requirements documents, and satisfies the user community.
FAS envisions the UES Upgrade to proceed in five sequential phases:






Phase-1: Discovery, Requirements Acceptance, Project Planning and High-level System
Design
Phase-2: Migrate database from Sybase to SQL Server and include a Microsoft Reporting
Services semantic layer for reporting
Phase-3: Convert code from ASP to .NET with integration of ad-hoc reporting
Phase-4: Implement new enhancements with updated reporting
Phase-5: Project Closeou

Additionally, a maintenance phase, Phase-6, is anticipated to follow Phase-5, as an incentive
award.

(4).
Effective Performance Measurement: Effective Performance Measurement will be put in
place for segmental implementation phases as well as for the entire UES upgrade system
development life cycle, using industry prevalent best practices such as Work Breakdown
Structure (WBS), Earned Value Management (EVM) and others. The contractor is requested to
propose well-defined performance metrics and measurement methodology for supporting a
performance-based contract structure, which allows incentives/disincentives against milestonebased deliverables. Metrics will be used to measure and track schedules, budgets, productivity,
defects, quality, earned value, cost to completion and risks, and to ensure that the end products
satisfy the performance objectives.
(5). Guiding Principles for UES Functions: The fully configured solution, including the
design and development of needed interfaces, should be capable of supporting the following
functions:
a) Provide staged deliverables so users can have benefit of the upgrade features before
he completion of the entire project.
b) Support the budgeting and accounting activities of the FAS Program Policy Staff
(PPS).
c) Accept online submission of Marketing Plans from FAS Cooperators and allow the
Cooperators to modify the plan during the course of the year and do full text editing
(with embedded images) on text parts of the Marketing Plan and allow cutting and
pasting from spreadsheets into the plan, where appropriate. Allow easy navigation of
he plan. Allow the viewing of historic plans.
d) Provide proposal evaluation and approval functionality.
e) Allow the Cooperators to submit requests for advances or reimbursement claims and
report on “actuals.”
f) Allow FAS staff and FAS attaché office staff to enter Marketing Plan evaluation data.
g) Provide specified canned reports.
h) Provide ad-hoc reporting capability against the UES data.
i) Support collaboration between Cooperators and FAS staff.
j) Conform to the FAS IT environment.
k) Provide a system that will support ease of maintenance and can be easily changed or
enhanced in the future.
(6).
UES Upgrade Tasks: The contractor will satisfactorily complete all tasks necessary to
implement all phases of the UES upgrade, including design, development, independen
acceptance testing, user acceptance testing, training, and the data conversion and database objec
conversion activities.
(7).
Effective Project Management: The contractor will provide effective management of
project schedule, performance, risks, warranties, subcontracts, and data to produce an upgraded
UES that satisfies all functionality requirements. The contractor is requested to describe a
proven, repeatable project management process that offers:
a) Integrated Master Plan or Integrated Master Schedule, with clear milestones, which
provide accurate and timely schedule and performance information throughout the
life cycle of the program.
b) Project management by certified Project Management Professional (PMP)

he project. The contractor will update the existing C & A (certification and accreditation)
documentation to conform to the upgraded system.
(9).
Configuration Management. The contractor will have a pre-planned configuration
management process to control the UES configuration for the life of the contract; document the
design of the UES product baseline; and establish and maintain an Integrated Product Team, to
include Government personnel, for insight into the design’s progress.
(10). Quality Assurance: The contractor will provide well-planned testing and tracking to
assure high-quality deliverables for each stage of system development, including system testing,
regression testing, load testing, user acceptance testing and bug tracking system, using industryprevalent tools and methodology.
(11). Quality Program: The contractor will develop and maintain a quality program to ensure
hat the UES upgrade is produced in accordance with the requirements, the FAS IT
environments, and program constraints. It should also develop and implement procedures to
properly maintain measuring system effectiveness and to ensure appropriate corrective action for
system failures.
(12). Reports and Documentation: The contractor will define, develop and deliver all reports
and data necessary to support UES maintainability throughout its life-cycle.
(13). Project Closeout Deliverables: At project closeout, upon notification by the USDA, the
contractor will submit all documentation, software, data, and other project material to FAS tha
has not already been turned over at the completion of a defined development task.
(14). Project Completion in Less Than Two Years: FAS requires that the entire UES Upgrade
Project be completed in less than 2 years. The offerors are requested to propose a detailed projec
plan and timeline that will optimally meet the FAS time constraints as stated herein.

C.1.9. Performance Standards (Metrics)
Table 4.2 below provides the “Performance Matrix” for supporting the Desired Outcomes and
associated Required Services /Deliverables for UES Upgrade as stipulated in section 4.1. Table
4.2 lists the Desired Outcomes (column B) and Required Services/Deliverables (column C,
referencing respective sections of Table 4.1) for each of the five program phases (Phase 1 to 5).
To facilitate performance-based award and penalty, the UES Upgrade project performance will
be assessed pursuant to a specified set of Performance Standards (Metrics) with
correspondingPositive/Negatives (award/penalty) mechanism for each phase.
In addition to the Desired Outcomes and the Required Services, Table 4.2 also provides
information (columns) pertaining to:
 Performance Standards (Metrics) (Column D),
 Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) (Column E),
 Monitoring Method (Column F),
 Positive/Negatives for meeting or not meeting AQL ( +1 or -1) (Column G),
 Assigned Weights in accordance with the relative importance of the respective
metrics for UES Upgrade mission (Column H), with respective “Cumulative
Weighted Range (-Mi, +Mi)” for each of the five phase (i = 1 to 5), and
 Positive/Negative performance performance structurestructure stipulated for each of
he five phases (last row of each phase).
Of the above, the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL), Assigned Weights, and Incentive/
Disincentive structure will be further fine-tuned and mutually agreed upon between FAS and the
Contractor to best suit FAS objectives.
The Contractor shall confirm its ability to meet the performance metrics and demonstrate its
knowledge of the performance management methodology (e.g. automated measurement and
reports) to best achieve the envisioned objectives. Should the contractor believe that it can either
do better or not meet performance metrics as suggested in the PWS, it may propose alternate
hresholds with justification.

C.1.10 Performance Assessments
Performance assessment will be made throughout each project phase pursuant to milestone-based
deliverables stipulated in the project plan for the phase. The contractor should formulate its
project plan such that ALL substantially completed deliverables are submitted to FAS
management for review and feedback well ahead (e.g. 45 days) of the final scheduled
completion date for the phase, to allow adequate time for Positive/Negatives determination and
for further improvement of the deliverables.
C.1.11. Proposed Tool for Tracking Software Defects
The contractor shall propose a tool that it has used in the past and also proposes to do so for the
UES upgrade project to track software defects of levels 1, 2 and 3. The contractor shall be
responsible for any cost associated with this tool. The contractor shall describe its process to
document software defects and their resolution via various software releases. FAS personnel
shall be granted access to this tool and have the absolute right to determine whether a defect is
classified as a level 1, 2 or 3 defect, view these defects and their resolution.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 32

C.1.12. Positives/Negatives
A Positive/Negative performance structure in the form of Positive Performance Phase and
Monetary Positive/Negatives provision is provided to reward superior performance and
encourage the contractor to deliver the system development/implementation services tha
achieves FAS’ UES Upgrade mission.
The objective is to enter into a mutually rewarding contractual relationship with a company
hroughout the contract duration consisting of an Initial Phase and multiple subsequent Positive
Performance Phases. The Positive Performance criteria (for reward and penalty) will be based on
he performance factors stipulated in the Performance Evaluation Matrix in Section 4
(Performance Standards). In addition, Monetary Positive/Negative Performance structures are
implemented pursuant to measured contract performance.
C.1.13. Positive/Negative performance structure
The incentive structure includes:
a)

Use of an Positive Performance Phase and Monetary Positive/Negatives provision to
provide maximum incentive to the contractor to excel,

b)
-

The Positive Performance Phase which will include:
Initial Phase (Phase-1: Discovery, Requirement Acceptance, Project Planning and
High-level System Design) to be initiated upon award of contract.
Phase-2 (Sybase Æ SQL Server migration) to be awarded based on measured
performance for Phase-1.
Subsequent Phases i (i= 3 and4), to be similarly awarded based on measured
performance of the previous phase (i-1).
Phase 5 – to be performed at project closeou
Monetary Positive/Negatives based on performance rating and effectiveness of
mitigating software defects.

c)
•
•
•
•
•

Positive Performance criteria based on the following factors stipulated in the
Performance Evaluation Matrix (Table 4.2) partially shown below, including:
Performance Standard (Metrics),
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL),
Monitoring Method,
Positive/Negatives Point (+1 or -1 for measured metric meeting or not meeting
AQL), and
Additional Assigned Weighting in accordance with the relative importance of the
metrics for achieving FAS’ mission, resulting in fully weighted sum in the range of [-Mi , + Mi]
points for each phase i (i= 1 to 5).

Rating Scheme:
Based on Performance Matrix (Table 4.2), the Positive/Negatives rating schemes for the five
phases (1 to 5) of UES Upgrade are stipulated as follows:

PHASE-1: Positive/Negative performance structure
1. Compute Phase-1 composite performance score K1 as algebraic summation of sub-scores in
columns-H, ranged [-10, +10]
2. Positive Performance Phase: If K1 ≥ +10 (Excellent), award next project phase (Phase-2);
otherwise no award of subsequent phases.
3. Withhold 3% of invoiced payment of Phase-1 to determine if the project plan will lead to a
smooth development in Phase-2. 97% of the invoiced amount shall become only payable upon
acceptance by FAS of deliverables associated with the invoice(s).
PHASE-2 Positive/Negative performance structure
1. Compute Phase-2 composite performance score K2 as algebraic summation of sub-scores in
columns-H, ranged [-26, +26].
2. Positive Performance Phase: if K2 ≥ +15 (Good), award next project phase (Phase-3);
otherwise no award of subsequent phases.
3. Monetary Positive/Negatives:
A.
If K2 ≥ +15 (Good), pay the 3% withheld from Phase-1 invoice(s), or if K2 ≥
+22 (Excellent) pay 3% withheld from Phase-1 invoice plus extra 3% of Phase-1
invoice as positive monetary bonus.
B.
Withhold 3% of invoiced payment of Phase-2 for assurance of mitigation of
software defects in major releases in Phase-2. 97% of the invoiced amount shall
become only payable upon acceptance by FAS of deliverables associated with the
invoice(s).
C.
During the next phase (Phase-3),
a.
If all documented Phase-2 software defects are fixed in less than 3 minor
releases and Phase-2 score K2 ≥ +22 (Excellent), then pay the 3%
withheld Phase-2 payment, plus extra 3% of Phase-2 invoice as positive
monetary bonus,
b.
If all documented Phase-2 software defects are fixed but in 3 minor releases
and Phase-2 score K2 ≥ +15 (Good), the pay back the 3% withheld
Phase-2 invoiced, and
c.
If the conditions stipulated in a. and b. are not met, no payment (withheld
payment or extra bonus) for Phase-2 will be made.
PHASE-3 Positive/Negative performance structure
1. Compute Phase-3 composite performance score K3 as algebraic summation of sub-scores in
columns-H, ranged [-33, +33].
2. Positive Performance Phase: if K3 ≥ +19 (Good), award next project phase (Phase-4);
otherwise no award of subsequent phases.
3. Monetary Positive/Negatives:

C.1.14. Deliverable Timeline for Performance Assessment
Performance assessment will be made throughout each project phase pursuant to milestone-based
deliverables stipulated in the project plan for the phase. The contractor should formulate its
project plan such that ALL substantially completed deliverables are submitted to FAS
management for review and feedback well ahead (e.g. 45 days) of the final scheduled completion
date for the phase, to allow adequate time for Positive/Negatives determination and for further
improvement of the deliverables.
C.1.15. Invoicing Guidelines to Comply with Positive/Negative performance structure
To ensure a smooth implementation of the Positive/Negative performance structure of Section
5.1, the contractor would be expected to itemize on each invoice:
(i)
Contractual Payable: 97% of all agreed upon amounts payable for a given
ask/subtask deliverable for each phase according to the terms and conditions of the
contract. This amount shall only become payable upon acceptance of the said
deliverables by FAS COTR.
(ii)
Withheld Payment: 3% of all agreed upon amounts payable for a given
ask/subtask deliverable for each phase according to the terms and conditions of the
contract. This amount shall be withheld and only become payable according to the
Positive/Negative performance structure of section 5.1 during the following phase,
only if FAS, at its sole discretion, makes the determination that this amount is
indeed payable according to the Positive/Negative performance structure.
(iii) Earned Bonus Payment: 3% of all agreed upon amounts payable for a
given task/subtask deliverable for each phase according to the terms and conditions
of the contract. This amount constitutes the earned bonus which shall only become
payable according to the Positive/Negative performance structure of section 5.1
during the following phase if FAS, at its sole discretion, makes the determination
hat this amount is indeed payable according to the Positive/Negative performance
structure. It should be understood that this line item will not be a part of the agreed
upon contract price.
The following provision is suggested for inclusion in the solicitation/resulting acquisition
1) Period of Performance: The initial contract period is approximately 3 months, covering the
Initial Phase (Phase-1) of the UES Upgrade effort. The contract period may be increased in se
increments for supporting the subsequent project phases as set forth in accordance with the
contract’s approved Positive Performance Evaluation Plan (IO PEP). It may be increased up to
four additional phases, to a maximum of five phases (Phases 2 to 5) over a period less than two
years from the date of contract award. Additionally, a maintenance phase (Phase-6) is anticipated
o follow Phase-5, as an incentive award. The maintenance phase is expected to last 12 months.
Conversely performance rated at less than ‘GOOD’ will be cause for deduction in set increments
consistent with the IO PEP.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 36

2) Positive Performance Evaluation Plan (IO PEP): The IO PEP will be negotiated with the
contractor prior to issuance of the task/delivery or contract award. The IO PEP may be
unilaterally revised by the Government and re-issued to the Contractor prior to the
commencement of any new Positive Performance evaluation period or during any evaluation
period with Contractor and the Contracting Officer approval. The IO PEP will provide for
evaluation of technical performance and serve as the basis for any Positive Performance
decisions. An Positive Performance Determination Official (IODO) will be appointed by the
Government and is responsible for the overall Positive Performance evaluation and subsequen
Positive Performance decisions.
3) Positive Performance Administration: The Positive Performance evaluation will be completed
on a phased basis as set forth in the Project Plan. The first Phase of the contract will be
evaluated for supporting the Positive Performance decision Rating Scheme as defined in Section
5 d) to determine the award of the next Phase (Phase-2). Similarly, Positive Performance
decisions using the defined Rating Scheme in Phases 2 to 4 will determine the award of the nex
Positive Performance phases 3 to 5 respectively.
4) Positive Performance Decisions: For the performance evaluation periods of a contract phase, the
final adjectival rating must be a “Good” or above for the Contractor to receive an additional
contract phase award. If at the end of any contract phase, the contractor performance is judged to
be less than “Good”, the Government at its sole discretion, with fifteen (15) days notification,
may choose to not extend the contract for any additional phases including Positive Performance
phase-6. The government at its sole discretion may, however, choose to extend the contract for a
certain number of months using previous phase’s pricing to facilitate the selection of a new
contractor via a new contract competition. The Positive Performance decisions are unilateral
decisions made solely at the discretion of the Governmen
5) Cancellation: Positive Performances that have been earned and awarded are subject to the
Termination and Limitation of Funds clauses of this contract. Cancellation of an Positive
Performance that has not yet commenced will not entitle the Contractor to any termination
settlement or any other compensation. The Government can cancel unearned Positive
Performance periods by providing written notice to the Contractor not less than 45 days before
he start of the Positive Performance phase. .
6) Review Process: The Contractor may request a review of a milestone-based Positive
Performance decision. The request shall be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer
within 15 days after notification of the Positive Performance decision. FAS will appoint a
Review Official to review any Positive Performance decision. Decisions by the Review Official
are considered "Final" and are not subject to further reviews or appeals. Decisions regarding the
Positive Performance, including but not limited to the period of the Positive Performance, if any;
he methodology used to calculate the Positive Performance; calculation of the Positive
Performance; the supplier's entitlement to the Positive Performance; and the nature and success
of the contractor's performance, are made by the Positive Performance Determination Officer
(IODO). These decisions are final and are not subject to dispute. The Contractor hereby
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 37

expressly waives any right of appeal or judicial review of the Positive Performance Evaluation
Plan and the Positive Performance decisions except as expressly set forth in this clause.
7) Contractor’s Self-Assessment. The Contractor’s self-assessment is voluntary, but shall be
submitted to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days after the end of the evaluation period.
This written assessment of the contractor’s performance throughout the evaluation period should
contain any information that the Contractor wishes to provide to the Performance Evaluation
Board (PEB) and the IODO for consideration in evaluating the Contractor’s performance. The
Contractor’s self-assessment may not exceed ten (10) pages (8.5” x 11”, not smaller than New
Times Roman 12 point type, single-space).

ADDITIONAL CLAUSES:

I.2 52.243-7 Notification of Changes. (APR 1984)
Definitions. Contracting Officer, as used in this clause, does not include any representative of the
Contracting Officer.
Specifically Authorized Representative (SAR), as used in this clause, means any person the
Contracting Officer has so designated by written notice (a copy of which shall be provided to the
Contractor) which shall refer to this subparagraph and shall be issued to the designated
representative before the SAR exercises such authority.
Notice. The primary purpose of this clause is to obtain prompt reporting of Government conduc
hat the Contractor considers to constitute a change to this contract. Except for changes identified
as such in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall notify the
Administrative Contracting Officer in writing promptly, within [ ] (to be negotiated) calendar
days from the date that the Contractor identifies any Government conduct (including actions,
inactions, and written or oral communications) that the Contractor regards as a change to the
contract terms and conditions. On the basis of the most accurate information available to the
Contractor, the notice shall state The date, nature, and circumstances of the conduct regarded as a change;
The name, function, and activity of each Government individual and Contractor official or
employee involved in or knowledgeable about such conduct;
The identification of any documents and the substance of any oral communication involved in
such conduct;
(4) In the instance of alleged acceleration of scheduled performance or delivery, the basis upon
which it arose;
(5) The particular elements of contract performance for which the Contractor may seek an
equitable adjustment under this clause, including (i) What contract line items have been or may be affected by the alleged change;

UES-PLN-QASP-R01C00

61

UES SOLICITATION FEB 2008

Services to Support the Upgrade for the Unified Export Strategy System
UES Upgrade

(ii) What labor or materials or both have been or may be added, deleted, or wasted by the alleged
change;
(iii) To the extent practicable, what delay and disruption in the manner and sequence of
performance and effect on continued performance have been or may be caused by the alleged
change;
(iv) What adjustments to contract price, delivery schedule, and other provisions affected by the
alleged change are estimated; and
(6) The Contractor's estimate of the time by which the Government must respond to the
Contractor's notice to minimize cost, delay or disruption of performance.
(c) Continued performance. Following submission of the notice required by paragraph (b) of this
clause, the Contractor shall diligently continue performance of this contract to the maximum
extent possible in accordance with its terms and conditions as construed by the Contractor,
unless the notice reports a direction of the Contracting Officer or a communication from a SAR
of the Contracting Officer, in either of which events the Contractor shall continue performance;
provided, however, that if the Contractor regards the direction or communication as a change as
described in paragraph (b) of this clause, notice shall be given in the manner provided. All
directions, communications, interpretations, orders and similar actions of the SAR shall be
reduced to writing promptly and copies furnished to the Contractor and to the Contracting
Officer. The Contracting Officer shall promptly countermand any action which exceeds the
authority of the SAR.
(d) Government response. The Contracting Officer shall promptly, within [ ] (to be negotiated)
calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in writing. In responding, the
Contracting Officer shall either (1) Confirm that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when
necessary direct the mode of further performance;
(2) Countermand any communication regarded as a change;
(3) Deny that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when
necessary direct the mode of further performance; or
(4) In the event the Contractor's notice information is inadequate to make a decision under
subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this clause, advise the Contractor what additional information
is required, and establish the date by which it should be furnished and the date thereafter by
which the Government will respond.
(e) Equitable adjustments. (1) If the Contracting Officer confirms that Government conduc
effected a change as alleged by the Contractor, and the conduct causes an increase or decrease in
he Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this

UES-PLN-QASP-R01C00

62

UES SOLICITATION FEB 2008

Services to Support the Upgrade for the Unified Export Strategy System
UES Upgrade

contract, whether changed or not changed by such conduct, an equitable adjustment shall be
made (i) In the contract price or delivery schedule or both; and
(ii) In such other provisions of the contract as may be affected.
(2) The contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. In the case of drawings, designs or
specifications which are defective and for which the Government is responsible, the equitable
adjustment shall include the cost and time extension for delay reasonably incurred by the
Contractor in attempting to comply with the defective drawings, designs or specifications before
he Contractor identified, or reasonably should have identified, such defect. When the cost of
property made obsolete or excess as a result of a change confirmed by the Contracting Officer
under this clause is included in the equitable adjustment, the Contracting Officer shall have the
right to prescribe the manner of disposition of the property. The equitable adjustment shall no
include increased costs or time extensions for delay resulting from the Contractor's failure to
provide notice or to continue performance as provided, respectively, in paragraphs (b) and (c) of
his clause.
Note: The phrases contract price and cost wherever they appear in the clause, may be
appropriately modified to apply to cost-reimbursement or incentive contracts, or to combinations
hereof.
(End of clause)

I.3 52.246-20 Warranty of Services. (MAY 2001)
(a) Definition.
Acceptance, as used in this clause, means the act of an authorized representative of the
Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership
of existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services, as partial or complete
performance of the contract.
(b) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government or any provision concerning
he conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that all services performed under this
contract will, at the time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform to the
requirements of this contract. The Contracting Officer shall give written notice of any defect or
nonconformance to the Contractor within 30 days from the date of acceptance by the
Government. This notice shall state either (1) That the Contractor shall correct or re-perform any defective or nonconforming services; or
(2) That the Government does not require correction or re-performance.
(c) If the Contractor is required to correct or re-perform, it shall be at no cost to the Government,
and any services corrected or re-performed by the Contractor shall be subject to this clause to the

UES-PLN-QASP-R01C00

same extent as work initially performed. If the Contractor fails or refuses to correct or reperform, the Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace with similar
services and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby, or make an
equitable adjustment in the contract price.
(d) If the Government does not require correction or re-performance, the Contracting Officer
shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price.

(a) Definition. As used in this clause-United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana
Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, during the term of this contract, the
Contractor shall post a notice, in the form of a poster, informing employees of their rights
concerning union membership and payment of union dues and fees, in conspicuous places in and
about all its plants and offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily

pertaining to National Labor Relations Board shall not be included in notices posted in the plants

Notice to Employees
Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a
union in order to retain their jobs.
Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security
agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However,
employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain
purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.
If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to
collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an
appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or
fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration,
or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in
future payments.

considered non responsive to this request for proposal and will receive no further
consideration.
(c) The technical proposal must include a detailed description of the techniques and
procedures to be employed in achieving the proposed end results in compliance with the
requirements of the Government Statements of Work incorporated herein. These detailed
descriptions must be cross referenced to the requirements of this RFP. Offerors are
encouraged to portray facts quantitatively wherever possible, with charts, lists, matrices,
abulations, etc.
(d) To facilitate the technical evaluation of Offerors' proposal, Offerors must follow the
formatting instructions presented below. Technical evaluators will be scoring technical
proposals solely on the basis of information provided by the Offerors, except "Pas
Performance." Information obtained on an offeror's "Past Performance" may be obtained
from the proposal as well as other sources. While it is acknowledged that the Offeror is
he subject matter expert on the material being presented, it is imperative that Offerors
provide specific responses to evaluation information requested in a common format to
facilitate the technical evaluation process. While it is not the desire of the Government to
penalize an Offeror for noncompliance with formatting instructions, Offerors may receive
lower overall technical evaluation point scores if requested information is not presented
in the Sections of the Technical Proposal where it is expected by evaluation personnel.
Technical evaluators will not be required to search other Sections of the Offerors

L.11 Preparation of the Business/Management and Cost Proposal (Part II)
(a) Business/Management (Section 1)
(1) This Section consists of the Offeror's outline, addressing the business/managemen
aspects of this procurement, the resources the Offeror will use and how the Offeror
will use them.
(2) Since the Business/Management Proposal will be evaluated to determine such matters
as a Contractor's potential for completing the required work, it should be specific and
complete. It must contain the information specified in Sections B and I of the RFP
with the Offeror's information added to Section B. Section B will be physically a par
of the contract at time of award.
(b) Cost Proposal ( Section 2)
(1) General
This Section shall consist of the Offeror's costs to perform the work outlined in the
Statement of Work. For cost evaluation purposes only the pricing proposed by the
offeror in Section B - PRICE SCHEDULE shall apply throughout the estimated
contract life. Contractor shall also provide a detailed breakdown of proposed
burdened labor rates as an attachment to Section B.

Realism in Request for Proposals
An Offeror's proposal is presumed to represent his best efforts to respond to the solicitation.
Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance, and cost or
price, should be explained in the proposal. For example, if the intended use of new and
innovative production techniques is the basis for an abnormally low estimate, the nature of
hese techniques and their impact on cost or price should be explained; or, if a corporate
policy decision has been made to absorb a portion of the estimated cost, that should be stated
in the proposal. Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, raises a fundamental issue of
he Offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and of his financial
ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal, (subject to
he requirements for discussions to be held with those Offerors in the competitive range
pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations). The burden of proof as to cost credibility rests
with the Offeror.

PART IV—Representations and instructions
SECTION M –Evaluation Factors for Award
M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD
Award will be made to the offeror proposing an approach which conforms to the Request For
Proposal (RFP) requirements and which represents the “Best Value” for the Government based
upon an integrated assessment of the factors described below.
Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation,
provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. To arrive at a best value
decision, the designated selection official will integrate the evaluation team’s evaluations of the
offeror’s proposal against the Evaluation Criteria. This approach may result in an award to a
higher-rated, higher-priced offfer, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation criteria
and the designated selection official reasonably determines that the expected benefits of the noncost criteria outweigh the Cost/Price difference.
M.2

EVALUATION FACTORS

The Evaluation Criteria are shown in order of importance below.
Technical Approach is significantly more important than Past Performance (including
references). Past Performance (including references) are less important than Technical
Approach, but more important than the Project Management Plan. The Project Managemen
Plan is less important than the Past Performance (including references), but more important than
he Staffing Plan.

Technical Factors:
The following factors will be used in the technical evaluation process, listed in
descending order of importance:
1. Technical Approach
2. Past Performance – including references
3. Project Management Plan
4. Staffing Plan

1. Technical Approach
A. General Technical Approach: Has the Offeror developed and provided a
response to the Statement of Work (SOW) that adequately and sufficiently addresses
he government’s objectives, technical and management considerations and
constraints into a specific and detailed process for conducting the required effort for
required services? How adequately has the Offeror addressed the following aspects of
its Technical Approach:
•
•

Understanding the Scope of the Project
Detailed Plan for Successful Performance

2. Past Performance (including References)
Offerors will be evaluated on the extent to which the Offeror and/or its subcontractors
demonstrate relevant past performance of similar size and scope, and Offeror has
demonstrated commitment to customer satisfaction, on schedule on time completion.
Offerors will be evaluated on the extent to which the Offeror and/or its subcontractors
demonstrate relevant references, consistent with Past Performance information. All Pas
Performance questionnaires are to be returned at least 5 days prior to the date of
submission of proposals, as indicated in Item 9. of the SF 33.
3. Project Management Plan
A. Management Plan: The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine the
adequacy of how the Offeror will effectively and efficiently bring their capabilities
(subcontractor(s), personnel and their education, experience, and expertise; depth of
resources; and effective and efficient management) to bear in order to satisfy the
requirements. Also the proposal will be evaluated on how the contractor will assure
seamless integration, effective and efficient communication and coordination of
information and work product between its staff and the Foreign Agricultural Services,
other government employees and other contracted staff. Strengths of approach to
managing staff, lines of communication, authority, responsibilities, and quality of
work assurance will also be considered.

4. Staffing Plan

Offerors will be evaluated on the extent to which the Offeror and/or its subcontractors
demonstrate the proposed personnel will provide an adequate workforce to complete the
job.
• Resources/Key Personnel
Evaluation will be based on the extent to which the Offeror demonstrates a
staffing plan that is adequate to successfully perform the requirements in
he SOW. In particular the resumes of key personnel will be evaluated to
assure that the training and experience are consistent with the proposed
positions and to the extent to which the resumes submitted

Non-Technical Factors: Price: PART II
1. Business Cost Proposal
The Business Cost Proposal must be assembled according to the instructions in Section L.11.
Failure to follow these instructions could result in low scoring of the Offeror’s proposal or even
disqualification. The Offeror’s Cost Proposal will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
Criteria A: Completeness: The Offeror must provide all the data that is necessary to suppor
he Cost Proposal as defined in Section L. The Government will assess the extent to which
Offeror’s cost proposal complies with the content and format instructions.
Criteria B: Cost: Proposed costs will be evaluated to determine if the cost estimates are
realistic and reasonable for the Tasks to be performed in the SOW, reflect a clear understanding
of the requirements, and are consistent with the experience level required to fulfill each labor
category.
Criteria C: Exceptions: Each exception identified by the Offeror will evaluated to determine
its impact on the tasks, scope and Government policy. A corresponding risk will be assigned to
each of the Offeror’s exceptions.

M.3

AWARD DETERMINATION
1. Award will be made to that offeror (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2)
whose technical/cost relationship is the most advantageous to the Government. Technical
Approach is significantly more important than Past Performance (including references).
Past Performance (including references) are less important than Technical Approach, bu
more important than the Project Management Plan. The Project Management Plan is less
important than the Past Performance (including references), but more important than the
Staffing Plan. The critical factor in making any cost/technical trade-off is not the spread
between the technical ratings, but, rather, the significance of that difference. The
significance of the spread of ratings will be determined on the basis of what the difference
might mean in terms of the performance and what it would cost the Government to take
advantage of it. Award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would
appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. The Governmen
reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and
advantageous to the Government.
2. Award may be made without further discussions. Offers should be submitted initially on
he most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint, which the contractor can
submit to the Government. The Government may, after evaluation of proposals, conduc
further oral or written discussion as appropriate, with all offerors whose proposals are within
a competitive range. The Government also reserves the right to make no award.

Services to Support the Upgrade for the Unified Export Strategy System
UES Upgrade Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Background
An important mission of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) is to improve foreign market access for U.S. products. The FAS operates
programs designed to build new markets and improve the competitive position of U.S.
agriculture in the global marketplace. FAS bears the primary responsibility for USDA’s
overseas activities—market development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and
he collection and analysis of statistics and market information. FAS also administers USDA’s
export credit guarantee and food aid programs and helps increase income and food availability in
developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth.
The data and information in the Unified Export Strategy (UES) system is vital to all FAS
program areas. During the 10 years since its original deployment, the UES system has expanded
in scope, functionality, and user base. It is the primary source of industry input used by FAS
staff, by Senior Executives in all of the Agency's program areas, by the Administrator, and
ultimately by the Under Secretary and Secretary in making key decisions for prioritizing and
allocating funds and staff resources for the programs and initiatives.
In recent years, as advances in technology have overtaken the current system, the number and
severity of UES shortcomings have grown. As a result, the USDA/FAS is in urgent need of
upgrading the UES system to improve operational efficiency, planning and coordination,
analysis of effectiveness, and performance measurement. FAS has, therefore, embarked on a
program to upgrade the UES system, with the twin goals of maximizing improvements in system
performance and utility to stakeholders while minimizing disruption to current users.
A Performance Work Statement (PWS) has been prepared to obtain the contracting services
necessary to develop and document a design to upgrade the UES system and to complete system
construction, user and system documentation, and deployment in the FAS production
environment. This work will result in the design, development, test and deployment of a system
o replace the current legacy UES.
In performance-based contracting efforts, the government defines the results it is seeking, rather
han the process by which the results are to be attained. The government also identifies the standards against which performance is measured, and positive and/or negative incentives. The term
“performance-based contracting” means that all aspects of an acquisition are structured around
he purpose of the work to be performed. Contract requirements are set forth in clear, specific,
and objective terms with measurable outcomes, as opposed to either the manner or by which the
work is to be performed or broad and imprecise statements of work. [Source: FAR 2.101].
1.2 Purpose
One of the cornerstones in a performance-based contract is the Quality Assurance Surveillance
Plan (QASP), a document that lists a set of criteria against which the success of a contracting
effort will be measured. In general, each criterion specifies:
The customer’s underlying goal or objective that is supported by the criterion, i.e., “what is the
government customer trying to accomplish?”
An activity (or required service) the contractor will perform to meet the criterion. This answers
he question: “what is the contractor going to do to help the government customer achieve the
goal?”
A statement quantifying success in meeting the criterion, or “how will the government customer
know when the contractor has met or failed to meet the goal?” and a description of how the
government customer will monitor the contractor to determine whether the goal has been met.

UES-QASP

97

Services to Support the Upgrade for the Unified Export Strategy System
UES Upgrade Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

A statement identifying the incentives the contractor will receive for helping the government
customer meet or exceed the goal and the corresponding disincentives for not meeting the goal.
Criteria for the QASP are selected on the following bases:
Importance—typically, the QASP only identifies measure of major importance to the program.
This reduces the cost of measurement and helps the customer and contractor focus on the mos
critical factors of the program.
Objectivity—measures that can be audited and verified by independent parties, if necessary, can
eliminate disagreements between the customer and the contractor as to whether or not a criterion
has been achieved.
Attainability—realistic goals provide the contractor with greater incentive than goals that canno
possibly be met.
Simplicity—straightforward measures are typically less costly and easier to demonstrate. An
overly complex measure may require a very expensive submission maintenance effort.
1.3 The Primary Methods of Surveillance
In general, cost-effective quality surveillance will involve a combinational use of the following
methods:
100 Percent Survey. This is recommended for mission critical issues and issues related to
actual system failures and incidents; otherwise, it is not cost-effective and is too stringent.
•
•
•
•

Random Sampling. Appropriate for recurring tasks or productions requirements.
Periodic Inspection. Use a pre-determined plan based on analyses of agency resources and
requirements.
Customer Input. Suitable for service-oriented tasks; use a standard form to document;
results reports from User Acceptance Testing efforts.
Contractor Self-Reporting. Monthly reports from the contractor that can detail problems
encountered, risk reporting, bug reports, status reports, EVM, etc.

The specific applications of these surveillance methods to this UES Upgrade contract are
described in the surveillance matrix included below as part of this QASP. Details of the
performance measurement scoring are in the PWS, table 4.2.
1.4 Scope
The Scope of Performance (Performance Requirements) is specified in the Work Performance
Statement (PWS, sections 2.3.4), and summarized in the Surveillance Matrix of this QASP
(Table 1). Additional checklists that the government may use to check the quality of work
products are included as appendices A through D.

2.1 Definition of Matrix Terms
The QASP elements contained in the surveillance matrix in Section 2.2 are defined as follows:

•
•

•
•
•

Performance Objective—Statement summarizing an expected result of the contract. Multiple
performance standards may apply to a single desired outcome. These sections align with the
Performance Work Statement (PWS) For UES Upgrade Development.
Required Service—one or more statements describing the service(s) required to be
performed by the contractor for the government achievement of the objective. In the
Surveillance Matrix table (Table 1), the “Required Services” column specifies the
“Performance Requirements” for respective PWS sections.
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL)—one or more concrete statements that identify the ideal
result(s) and the minimum acceptable result(s) of the required service. The “Acceptable
Quality Level” summarizes the AQL in the PWS (table 4.1).
Surveillance Method—the manner by which the government will determine whether the AQL
of performance has been achieved.
Incentives for Meeting/Disincentives for not Meeting AQL—identifies any rewards the
contractor will receive as a result of exceeding the performance standard, as well as any
penalties the contractor will incur for failing to meet the AQL. ThePositive/Negatives
summarizes the incentives/disincentives outlined in the PWS (table 4.2).

It is the objective of this contract to fulfill the specified requirements and ensure a quality
product as measured by the surveillance methods specified.

UES Upgrade Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

Attachment 3 – GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Glossary: Definitions
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL): The variance from a performance standard that a contractor is
allowed, before the Government rejects its services or commodities. Generally speaking, a contractor will
be given an opportunity to correct non-conforming services if it can be accomplished within the required
delivery schedule.
Acceptance Sampling: A form of sampling used to determine a course of action. A procedure that gives
a specified risk of accepting lots of given quality.
Activity: Another name for a work process. (An activity uses inputs and generates outputs.)
AQL: See Acceptable Quality Level.
Attribute: The property a unit has of being either bad or good. That is, the quality characteristic of a uni
is either within the specified requirements or it is not.
Attribute Sampling: A form of acceptance sampling that grades a service as defective or non-defective.
Best Value: The expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the
greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. (FAR Part 2.101)
Contract: A term used to describe a variety of agreements or orders for the procurement of supplies or
services. An agreement, enforceable by law, between two or more competent parties, to do or not to do
something, which is not prohibited by law, for a legal consideration.
Contract Administration: That stage of the contracting cycle in which the contracting officer insures
hat the total contract is being followed, makes necessary changes to the contract, and insures progress
oward contract completion.
Contract Modification: Any unilateral or bilateral written alterations in the specification, delivery point,
rate of delivery, contract period, price quantity, or other clause of an existing contract, accomplished in
accordance with a contract clause (e.g., change order, notice of termination, supplemental agreement,
exercise of a contract option, and so forth).
Contract Types: Refers to specific pricing arrangements employed for the performance of work under
contract. Specific pricing (or compensation) arrangements, expressed as contract types, include firm-fixed
price, fixed price incentive, cost plus fixed fee, cost plus incentive fee, cost plus award fee, and several
others. Among special arrangements that use fixed-price or cost reimbursement pricing provisions are
instruments called indefinite delivery contracts, basic ordering agreements, letter contracts and others.
Contracting Officer (CO): Any person who, either by virtue of position or by appointment in accordance
with prescribed regulations, is vested with the authority to enter into and administer contracts and make
determinations and findings with respect thereto, or with any part of such authority.

UES-QASP

119

Services to Support the Upgrade for the Unified Export Strategy System
UES Upgrade Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): A Federal employee to whom a contracting officer has
delegated limited authority in writing to make specified contract-related decisions. Also referred to as
Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).
Contractor's Quality Control Plan: The methodology put into place by a contractor to monitor or
control the performance of services, in order to meet PWS requirements.
Contract Specialist: The person responsible for administering the day-to-day business aspects of the
contract, including non-technical contract monitoring and preparing modifications, such as:
1) changes in the Statement of Work;
2) changes in delivery schedules;
3) extend or modify the period of performance; or
4) otherwise change any terms or conditions in the contract. This individual reviews invoices to
assure that all costs are being billed in accordance with the terms of the contract and indirect rate
agreement.
COR/COTR: See Project Officer.
Cost Realism: The costs in an offeror's proposal: (1) are realistic for the work to be performed; (2) reflec
a clear understanding of the requirements; and (3) are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's
echnical proposal. (FAR 15.801)
Customer Complaints: This is the least preferred method of surveillance because it cannot be used as a
basis of deduction from payment since it is not a statistically valid method of surveillance. Further,
customer complaints may not always relate to actual requirements of the contract, and verification of
customer complaints can be extremely labor intensive. Its use, however, may be necessary for certain
ypes of tasks that do not lend themselves to random sampling or 100-percent inspection. The contracting
officer may use validated customer complaints as the basis for actions (other than payment deductions)
against the contractor. In such cases, the Inspection of Services clause becomes the basis for the
contracting officer's actions.
Deduction: The contract clause, Inspection of Services, provides a means to reduce payment to the
contractor for services not satisfactorily performed by the contractor. In short, if the Government does no
receive the service, it does not pay the contractor. The procedure for withholding payments to a contractor
is referred to as "deduction." To legally make a deduction from a contractor payment, the amoun
deducted must correlate to the price of the service not performed; it may not be an arbitrary figure. Thus,
it is necessary to determine what percentage of the total cost of a contract each service performed under
hat contract represents.
Defect: Any nonconformance with requirements specified in the contract.
Error Rate: The frequency at which defective service occurs.
Evaluation Analysis: The third phase of Requirements Analysis in which the Government's quality
assurance surveillance methods are determined.
FAS: The meaning in this acquisition will mean Foreign Agricultural Service

Firm-Fixed-Price Contract: Provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the
contractor's cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor
maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum
incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum
administrative burden upon the contracting parties. (FAR 16.202-1)
FSA: The Farm Service Agency (FSA).
FSA/AMD: Services and commodities are purchased by the FSA, Acquisition Management Division
(FSA/AMD). (Our parent agency is the FSA.)
Incentive: Stated rewards and/or consequences that may be employed to motivate a contractor to achieve
higher levels of performance under a given contract; can be monetary or non-monetary; can be based on
schedule, management, or cost. An incentive may be positive or negative.
Indifference Quality Level (IQL): The point that divides acceptable from unacceptable performance.
Indirect Cost: Any cost not directly identified with a single final cost objective but identified with two or
more final cost objectives or with at least one intermediate cost objective. Also, referred to as overhead or
burden.
Indicator: An indicator is an essential characteristic of acceptable performance.
Input: Anything put into a system or process or expended in its operation to achieve a result or output.
Inspection of Services Clause: All service contracts, as outlined in FAR Subpart 46.3, contain a
requirement, in the Inspection of Services contract clause, that the contractor provide and maintain an
inspection system acceptable to the government. This is commonly referred to as the contractor's quality
control (QC) plan. The contractor must keep records of his or her quality control inspections under this
system throughout the life of the contract. The Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) must also keep
records of any inspections of the contractor's
quality control procedures, including QC records, for the life of the contract.
Integrated Project Team: Referred to as an IPT, an integrated project team is a multi-disciplinary team
lead by a program manager responsible and accountable for planning, budgeting, procurement and lifecycle management of the investment to achieve its cost, schedule and performance goals. Team skills
include: budgetary, financial, capital planning, procurement, user, program, value management, earned
value management, and other staff as appropriate. (OMB Circular A-11 2003)
IPT: See Integrated Project Team.
Job Analysis: The act of looking at a job as it is being done in-house or a contractor to determine wha
actually results. Job analysis looks at organization, workload, performance values, and resources.
Lot: A collection of service outputs from which a sample is to be drawn and inspected to determine
conformance with the standard.
Lot Size: The number of service outputs in a lot.
Non-Research and Development Requirements: Those needs for services to be acquired from nongovernmental sources by contract. These requirements support or improve agency policy development,

improve skills, assist in decision-making, management, and administration or support or improve the
operation of management systems. These requirements include areas such as: advisory and assistance
services; information technology functions; engineering studies; clinical medicine; and training.
One Hundred Percent Inspection: This surveillance type is preferred for those tasks that occur
infrequently. This includes tasks that cannot be random sampled because the sample size for a small lo
may exceed the lot size. It is also used frequently for those tasks having very stringent performance
requirements. When this type surveillance is used, the QAE must inspect and evaluate the contractor's
performance each time it is performed. The results of the contractor's overall performance is then
evaluated to determine acceptability of the lot.
Option: The right of the Contracting Officer to exercise, or not exercise, a pre-negotiated contract line
item within an acquisition in the accordance with the best interests of the government, whether it is of a
echnical nature or a funding issue. Options do not have to be exercised on the behalf of the government.
Output: The amount of something produced by a system or process during a given span of time.
Partnering: Partnering is a technique for preventing disputes from occurring. Under this concept, the
agency and contractor, perhaps along with a facilitator, meet after contract award to discuss their mutual
expectations. The parties mutually develop performance goals, identify potential sources of conflict, and
establish cooperative ways to resolve any problems that may arise during contract performance.
PBC: See Performance-Based Contracting.
PBSA: Acronym for Performance-Based Services Acquisition. See Performance-Based-Contracting
(PBC).
PBSC: See Performance-Based Contracting.
Percent of Sample Found Defective: Determined by dividing the number of defects by the sample size
when the reject number has been equaled or exceeded. The resulting number is used to make an equitable
deduction from the contract price for non-performance by the contractor.
Performance Analysis: The second phase of Requirements Analysis in which indicators, standards and
he Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for key tasks are identified.
Performance-Based: Being associated with outcome rather than with process.
Performance-Based Contracting (PBC): Structuring all aspects of an acquisition around the purpose of
he work to be performed as opposed to either the manner by which the work is to be performed or broad
and imprecise statements of work. May also be referred to as Performance-Based Service Contracting
(PBSC).
Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA): An acquisition field term for Performance-BasedContracting (PBC).
Performance Indicator: A characteristic of an output that can be measured. It can measure quantity as
well as quality. By using a performance indicator and its associated standard, it is possible to determine if
a process is producing a quality output.

Performance Requirement: The point that divides acceptable and unacceptable performance of a task
according to the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) and the Inspection of Service Clause. It is
he number of defectives or maximum defective in the lot that is deemed acceptable. Any further
defectives will require the Government to effect the price computation system.
Performance Requirements: The results the contractor is required to achieve.
Performance Requirements Summary (PRS): A document that contains information about: the key
services that a contractor is required to perform; standards to enable the government to test the quality of
a contractor's performance; and surveillance methods to be used.
Performance Standard(s): A defined level of performance against which the quality of contracted
services can be measured.
Performance Work Statement (PWS): Section C of the request for proposals and of the contract;
includes any description or specifications needed in addition to Section B. Defines requirements in clear,
concise language identifying specific work to be accomplished. To the maximum extent practicable the
statement of work will 1) Describe the work in terms of "what" is to be the required output rather than
"how" the work is to be accomplished or the number of hours to be provided; 2) enable assessment of
work performance against measurable performance standards; 3) rely on the use of measurable
performance standards and financial incentives in a competitive environment to encourage competitors to
develop and institute innovative and cost-effective methods of performing the work; and 4) avoid
combining requirements into a single acquisition that is too broad for the agency or a prospective
contractor to manage effectively.
Periodic Surveillance: This type of surveillance consists of the evaluation of samples selected on other
han a 100% or statistically random basis. An example of periodic surveillance is weekly inspections
when the QAE chooses the location and time in other than a statistically random manner. This is not a
preferred method of surveillance and cannot be used as a basis of deduction from payments because i
does not provide a statistical basis for deducting for nonconforming performance. Tasks shown on the
PRS as having periodic surveillance will have no maximum payment percentage calculation in the fifth
column of the PRS. The contracting officer may use the results of periodic surveillance inspections as the
basis for actions (other than payment deductions) against the contractor. In such cases, the Inspection of
Services clause becomes the basis for the contracting officer's actions.
Price: Cost plus any fee or profit applicable to the contract type.
Profit: Generally characterized as the basic motive of business enterprise. In contract pricing, profi
represents the projected or known monetary excess realized by a producer or performer after the
deduction of cost (both direct and indirect) incurred or to be incurred in the performance of a job, task or
series of the same.
Progress Payment: A payment made as work progresses under a contract on the basis of percentage of
completion accomplished, or for work performed at a particular stage of completion.
Project Officer: The person responsible for the technical direction of the contract, including: 1)
monitoring technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending
o the Contracting Officer changes in requirements: 2) interpreting the statement of work and any other
echnical performance requirements; 3) performing technical evaluation as required; 4) performing
echnical inspections and acceptances required by this contract; and, 5) assisting in the resolution of
echnical problems encountered during performance.

PRS: See Performance Requirements Summary.
PWS: See Performance Work Statement.
QA: See Quality Assurance.
Qualitative Performance Standards: A standard which measures quality.
Quality Assurance: Those actions taken by the government to check goods or services to determine tha
hey meet the requirements of the SOW.
Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE): A functionally qualified person who performs quality assurance
functions for a contracted service.
Quality Assurance Plan (QAP): A detailed plan setting forth the process that will be used to measure
contractor performance; defines what the agency must do to ensure that the contractor has performed in
accordance with the PWS performance standards. May also be referred to a Quality Assurance
Surveillance Plan.
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP): This plan measures performance against standards in the
Performance Work Statement. A good QASP should include a surveillance schedule and clearly state the
surveillance method(s) to be used. The QASP also establishes how resources will be used to ensure tha
he government receives what it is paying for. Development of the QASP also allows the government to
clearly define the amount of contract administration resources needed. The detail regarding a particular
ask should be commensurate with the importance of the task. The QASP should focus on the quality,
quantity, and timeliness, etc., of the performance outputs to be delivered by the contractor, and not on the
steps required or procedures used to provide the product or service. May also be referred to as a Quality
Assurance Plan (QAP).
Quantitative Performance Standards: A standard which measures quantity.
QAP: See Quality Assurance Plan.

Result: An intended, measurable change (of a condition, an outcome, or a product of a process); needs to
be thought of in terms of an end state (for example, established) rather than as a process (for example, to
establish).
Risk: An assumption of possible monetary loss or gain in light of the job or work to be done. One of the
elements to be considered in the negotiation of a fair and reasonable price, as well as in determining the
ype of contract under which performance will occur.
Sample: A sample consists of one or more service outputs drawn from a lot, the outputs being chosen a
random.
Sampling: A method of obtaining statistics from a large body of data without resorting to a complete
census. Two broad methods of selecting samples are probability sampling (in which sample units are
selected according to the law of chance) and non-probability sampling (in which personal choice, exper
judgment, or some other non-probabilistic rationale is used to select sample units).
Sampling Guide: The part of the surveillance plan which contains all the information needed to perform
a random sample.
Sampling Method: The actual means of evaluating a contractor's performance.
Sampling Plan: A plan which indicates the AQL, the number of units from each lot which are to be
inspected (sample size) and the criteria for determining the acceptability of the lot (acceptance and
rejection numbers)
Service: A job performed to the standard and with the acceptable quality level. The contractor must do
he specific job, and meet the standard, and meet the acceptable quality level before one can say tha
performance has been acceptable and that he/she should be paid.

incorporated into performance-based service acquisitions in order that competitors may propose their
solutions including a technical approach, performance standards and a quality assurance surveillance plan
based upon commercial business practices.
Statement of Work: A document that describes accurately the essential and technical requirements for
items, materials, or services including the standards used determine whether the requirements have been
met. In Performance-Based Contracting the SOW is referred to as a Performance Work Statement (PWS)
o reflect the emphasis on measuring performance.
