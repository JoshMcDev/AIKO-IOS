52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor
information required for the conduct of business with the Government.
Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.
(D&B) to identify unique business entities.
Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)
This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records
for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same
parent concern.
Registered in the CCR database means that-(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number,
into the CCR database; and
(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active”.
(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be
registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic
agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation
“DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address
exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is
registered in the CCR database.
(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet a

who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.
(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any
liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR
database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date
of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and
complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a
substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The
Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

he agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or changeof-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the

he CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of
Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR
record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will

requirements of this solicitation may be evaluated further.
2. Contract Award. OFFERORS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE
OFFERS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS; THEREFORE, OFFERS SHOULD PROPOSE THEIR
BEST OFFER INITIALLY. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions. In accordance with FAR
15.306(d)(2), the objective of discussions is “to maximize the Government’s ability to obtain best value, based on
he requirement and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.” Should discussions be deemed necessary due
o proposal weakness, deficiency, or other issues, which must be addressed before award, they will be conducted
either orally and/or in writing, with only those offerors determined to be within the competitive range. The
Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest, and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
3. Teaming Arrangement. When an Offeror proposes to use a subcontractor or submits an offer based on a
eaming arrangement with another contractor, the Offeror must supply all of the requested information, not only as i
pertains to the Offeror, but also as it pertains to the subcontractor or partner. The Offer must also provide specific

C. PROPOSAL CONTENTS:
1. Standard Form 1449 (Refer to information in Volume I, Section 1)
2. Price (Volume I, Section 2) The offeror will provide completed SF 1449 Continuation Sheet(s) from the Schedule in this solicitation.
Given the applicability of the Service Contract Act (SCA) of 1965, as Amended (FAR 52.222-41), to this solicitation
and the resulting contract, and the expectation that we will realize periodic increases to the applicable minimum
wage rates and/or health and welfare benefits associated with the workers employed under this contract, we are
seeking specific information from your firm describing how any such increases will impact your proposed percentage
of savings. Simply responding that an increase in wages/benefits will adversely affect the proposed percentages will
be considered an insufficient response. The response to this issue should be in sufficient detail to allow for a clear,
calculable, understanding of the potential impact. You may elect to provide detailed proposal calculations (e.g.,
labor costs, supplies/equipment costs, etc.) and/or pricing data that was not otherwise provided with your proposal,
and include a sample calculation of the impact of a proposed future change. By whatever means elected, your
explanation should be detailed enough so as to not require additional follow-up questions from the Contracting
Officer on this matter.
Related Information. As this solicitation is for a firm fixed-price contract award conducted under FAR Part 12,
Commercial Items, and adequate competition is expected, no cost or pricing data is required. However, the
Contracting Officer reserves the right to require such data if unable to determine the proposed price to be reasonable
or realistic, or to resolve any apparent unbalanced pricing.
3. Past Performance (Volume 1, Section 3) Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their proposal for their company, and all proposed major
subcontractors, partners, members of a teaming arrangement, members of a joint venture, etc. NOTE: This
information should be submitted as soon as practicable in order to facilitate the Government’s ability to reduce the
evaluation time period.

must be able to provide information on their business experiences with your company relating
o the following: (1) quality history/overall customer satisfaction, and (2) business relations, to
include the business aspects of performance. Contracts listed shall include other Governmen
agencies, agencies of any state or local government, and any commercial customers or

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS

A. BASIS OF AWARD: The successful contractor to receive the contract award will be determined using the best
value, trade-off method. The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible
offeror whose offer represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and sub-factors in the
solicitation. The following factors and sub-factors will be used to evaluate offers:

HDEC02-04-R-0002
Page 17 of 71

I.

Technical Capability
a. Customer Satisfaction
b. Increase Sales
c. Continue Customer Savings
d. Quality Assurance Program
e. Transition Approach

II.

Past Performance
a. Quality History/Overall Customer Satisfaction
b. Business Relations

III.

Price

As a best value trade-off acquisition, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the offeror with the
most favorable price or the offeror with the highest ranked technical or past performance rating.
B. RELATIVE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE OF THE EVALUATION FACTORS: Of the evaluation factors
shown above, the evaluation factor “Technical Capability” is significantly more important than “Past Performance.”
The evaluation factors within Technical Capability, “Customer Satisfaction,” “Increase Sales,” “Continue Customer
Savings,” and “Quality Assurance Program” are equally important, and significantly more important than “Transition
Approach.”
Within Past Performance, “Quality History/Overall Customer Satisfaction” is equal to, “Business Relations.”
Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are considered to be significantly more important than
Price (percentage of patron savings).
C. PAST PERFORMANCE: Past performance will be evaluated based on the offeror’s relationship and
performance history with their customers and suppliers. In evaluating past performance, the Government will use the
references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: federal, state and
local Government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. The Governmen
will also consider all in-house information available, such as, but not limited to, the offeror Performance Evaluations
(DeCA Form 10-17), past performance surveys, emails and correspondence on file regarding an offerors
performance on current DeCA contracts. The evaluation of past performance will be an assessment based on a
consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable
performance, but an offeror's overall past performance history. The Government will seek to determine whether the
offeror has consistently complied with the terms and conditions of contracts and the standard of quality products
provided under their contracts. This determination is subjective and a matter of judgment.
NOTE: Companies lacking relevant past performance history will be evaluated on past performance
information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors
hat will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instan
acquisition.
D. PRICE: The Government will evaluate an offeror’s proposed percentage of savings for price realism in relation
o the total requirements of the solicitation and the offeror’s technical proposal. An evaluated price will be
calculated for the base period, all option periods, and all award term periods (by CLIN) as described under the
paragraph below entitled “Evaluation of Options and Award Terms”.
E. EVALUATION OF OPTIONS AND AWARD TERMS: The Government will evaluate offers for award
purposes by adding the total evaluated price for all option years and award term periods to the evaluated price for the
base period of performance. The total evaluated price will be determined by applying the offeror’s proposed
percentage of savings for each performance period to 80% of the historical bakery sales dollars for each performance
period. These calculations will continue through all eight potential periods (base + options + award terms).

HDEC02-04-R-0002
Page 18 of 71
Evaluated prices for the base, options and award terms will be added together to determine the offer’s Total
Evaluated Price. Evaluation of options and award terms will not obligate the government to exercise these terms,
except as otherwise described in this solicitation.
F. VALUE OF THE CONTRACT: The value of the contract will be an estimate based upon bakery historical
sales figures (Attachment 3) for the base year, option years, and award terms.
G. NOTIFICATION: A written notice of award or acceptance of a proposal, mailed or otherwise furnished to the
successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract withou
further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer,
whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
H. SOURCE SELECTION DECISION: Under this solicitation, the Best Value Tradeoff Method will be utilized
o determine contract award. If the contracting officer considers a higher rated technical capability/pas
performance, lower priced (% of patron savings) proposal, to be worth more than a lower rated technical
capability/past performance, higher evaluated price (% of patron savings), then the more capable, lower evaluated
priced offer will be the better value, and will be selected for award. If not, then the lower rated, higher evaluated
priced offer will be the better value, and will be selected for award.

F. AWARD TERM (CLAUSE) (pass/fail)

Award term is an acquisition technique for recurring requirements rewarding the contractor for their overall
exceptional performance with a long-term relationship. It provides the contractor opportunities to earn additional
periods in one-year increments for their performance based on Government evaluation of contractor performance in
areas such as customer service, continued savings, increased sales and produced variety, quality, special orders,
promotional items, and a product mix to maximize patron satisfaction. Potential benefits are maintaining a long-term
contractual relationship with a quality contractor, and continuous improvement in contract performance resulting in
increased sales, improved customer satisfaction, and continued savings to the patron.
The contractor earns an award term based on a pass/fail scoring method in which the Government evaluates the Contractor’s
overall performance at the end of the award term evaluation period as excellent, acceptable, or unacceptable, without assigning
points as provided in Technical Exhibit B of this contract, entitled, “Award Term Plan”. The Government will make an interim
assessment every 6 months in order to provide feedback to the Contractor. The Government decides at the end of the award term
evaluation period whether the Contractor’s performance was good enough overall to merit an award term.
(a) Award Term. The award-term concept is an incentive that permits extension of the contract period beyond the
base period of performance for overall excellent performance or reduction of the contract period of performance
beyond the base period because of poor performance.
(b) Monitoring of Performance. The performance monitors, whose findings are reported to the Award Term Board
(ATB), continually monitor the contractor’s performance. The ATB recommends an award term to the Term
Determining Official (TDO), who makes the final decision on whether the contractor has earned an award term.
(c) Award-Term Plan. The evaluation criteria and the associated award-term extensions or reductions are specified in
he award-term plan.
(d) Self-Evaluation. At the option of the Contractor, the Contractor may (1) request an opportunity to address the
ATB in person with a self-evaluation or the company’s performance, or (2) submit to the Contracting Officer,
within 15 calendar days after the end of each award-term evaluation period, a brief written self-evaluation of its
performance for that period. If the Contractor requests an opportunity to address the ATB in person, the person
addressing the ATB must be employed in a management position within the Contractor’s organization. If the
contractor appears in person the written portion is not necessary. The Contractor’s self-evaluation, in the forma
presented, will be used in the ATB evaluation of the contractor’s performance during this period. Costs
associated with the Contractor’s efforts in this regard will not be reimbursed under this contract.
(e) Award-Term Extension. The contract shall be unilaterally modified to reflect any award term extension.
The total contract performance period, including extensions under this clause, shall not exceed eight years.
(f)

The Contractor’s proposal will be incorporated herein by reference.

(g) The chart that follows will be the Contractors proposed increase in sales.

If the Contractor has not earned an award term by the end of the second year of performance under this contract, the Government
may declare the award-term incentive void.
Once the Contractor has earned an award term, they must earn an award term in each succeeding year. If the Contractor fails to
earn an award term in a succeeding year, the Government may declare the award-term incentive void and cancel any award terms
hat the contractor has earned, but have not commenced.
If, in any year, the Contracting Officer decides that the Contractor’s performance was determined unacceptable, then the term
determining official may declare the award-term incentive void and cancel any award terms that the Contractor has earned, bu
have not commenced.
Any changes to the award term determination criteria which shall apply during each award term period will be provided to the
Contractor in writing by the Contracting Officer at least 30 days prior to the start of each award term period. Notification at a
later date, or alteration of criteria, including added criteria, after an award term period has begun, must be agreed to by both
parties.
The Contractor may cancel any award term before it begins by giving the Contracting Officer written notice at least one year in
advance. The Contractor may not cancel any award term with less than one year advance notice, or terminate any award term
hat has already begun. Should the Contractor elect to cancel any award term, the operation of the award-term incentive will end
immediately and all remaining award terms that the Contractor has earned are canceled.
The cancellation of any award terms or the voiding of the award-term incentive for any of the reasons set forth in this clause shall
not be considered a termination for convenience nor a termination for default and shall not entitle the contractor to any equitable
adjustment or any other compensation.
All award-term extensions are conditioned upon (1) a continuing Agency need for the contract services, and (2) the continuing
responsibility of the Contractor, as defined by FAR 9.104-1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this clause, the Government retains the right to terminate this contract for convenience or
cause in accordance with FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items.

1. SCOPE OF WORK
1.1. Introduction. A military commissary is a Government facility providing resale food items and other
merchandise to authorized individuals, termed “patrons.” It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial
supermarkets. The commissary’s goals are to provide a cost savings for patrons when compared to commercial
markets, to provide courteous and informative assistance to patrons, to offer a variety of items in quantities to satisfy
patron demands, and to make the items available to patrons in a clean, safe, and wholesome environment. Overall
management and operation of a commissary is the responsibility of the Store Director of each commissary store,
operating within Agency policy and standards. The Store Director responds to the support requirements of patrons,
meets with consumer groups, and acts as liaison for the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) at the installation
level.
1.2. General. This contract is written and will be administered as a Performance Based Services Acquisition
(PBSA). This method of contracting requires that the Government describe the requirements the Contractor mus
meet in terms of outcome or results. The “how” is left to the Contractor, within certain regulatory guidelines as
referenced herein. This allows the Contractor more flexibility in achieving the desired results. The Contractor shall
execute its responsibilities under this contract in a manner that is consistent with the performance standards
contained herein.
1.2.1. The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, supervision, food products, and other items (unless otherwise
specified) necessary to operate a well-stocked bakery resale operation offering a variety of items in quantities to
satisfy customer demands and maximize customer satisfaction at the locations specified in the schedule.
1.2.2. Services and Sales. The contractor shall provide fast, friendly, courteous services that result in high levels of
customer satisfaction and increased sales.
1.2.3. Savings. The Contractor shall provide a cost savings to the patron over the costs of same or similar items
from comparable commercial operations within the local commuting area (as set forth in the schedule) of Contractor
performance (excludes membership clubs and convenience type stores).
1.2.4. Ownership of Products. Ownership of bakery resale products will remain with the contractor until scanned
(or keyed, if not scan able) at a DeCA authorized register.
1.2.5. Contractor Reimbursement. The Contractor and commissary personnel shall reconcile the amounts of the
bakery sales recorded on the scanning system daily. Payment will be based on a weekly rollup of the reconciliation
records by the commissary.
2. PERSONNEL
2.1 General. The Contractor shall provide an adequate number of personnel possessing the “people skills” and the
food handling skills, knowledge, training, licensing and certifications needed to satisfactorily perform all work
required by this contract. The Contractor shall not employ current commissary employees without written approval
from the Agency General Counsel’s Office.

AWARD TERM PLAN
## FOR
IN-STORE BAKERY OPERATIONS

HDEC02-04-R-0002
Page 43 of 71
This plan describes the method for assessing the Contractor’s performance against the matrix described in the
Performance Assessment Plan, Appendix A, and determining whether such performance merits an additional award
erm extension. The Award Term Plan serves as the basis for all award term decisions.
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Award term is an acquisition technique for a recurring requirement that rewards a Contractor for excellen
performance with a long-term relationship by extending the term of the contract without requiring the Contractor to
complete anew. Award terms are periods of a predetermined length (e.g., one year), which are specified in the
contract. The length of an award term does not vary with the quality of the Contractor’s performance.
An award-term extension is not an option, but an actual contract extension, conditioned only upon a continuing
Government need for the services, and the Contracting Officer determines the Contractor to be responsible in
accordance with FAR 9.104-1. The terms of the incentive are stipulated in the award-term clause contained in the
contract.
2.0 INCENTIVE OBJECTIVES
The primary focus of the contract is on the end results of excellent customer service; continued savings when
compared to commercial prices; increased sales in the department; and a combination of product variety, quality,
special orders, promotional items, and a product mix to maximize patron satisfaction at the locations specified in the
schedule. The contract allows the Contractor to deliver the required services by applying its own best practices and
innovative approaches to accomplish the desired end results throughout the life of the contract. The award term
incentive further motivates the Contractor to perform to the best of its capability.
3.0 AWARD-TERM PROCESSES
(a) Organizational Structure. The organizational structure established for administering the award term provision of
he contract is provided at Appendix C. The responsibilities assigned to each position are set forth therein. The
award term evaluation procedures follow.
(b) Evaluation Criteria, Ratings and Definitions. Adjectival assessments will be assigned to each incentive
performance evaluation criterion as shown in Appendix B. A rating will be assigned for each major evaluation
criterion for each evaluation period.
4.0 RATING GUIDELINES
(a) Rating Methodology. The Contractor earns the award term based on a pass/fail rating method in which the
Government will evaluate the Contractor’s overall performance at the end of the award term evaluation period as
excellent, acceptable, or unacceptable, without assigning points.
(b) General Characteristics of Levels of Performance. The incentive performance evaluation criteria, ratings, and
standards contained in Appendix B are intended as a guide to describe performance characteristics, which represent a
level of performance with a correlating adjectival rating. It is not intended that any of the listed performance
descriptions will exactly describe the Contractor’s performance, nor is it intended that Contractor’s performance in
all areas necessarily fall in any one level. Rather, the general characteristics of levels will be used as a tool to selec
he level of performance which best characterizes the Contractor’s overall performance for the evaluation period.
(c) Interim Award Term Evaluations. An interim assessment will be accomplished six months into the performance
evaluation period. Award-term performance monitoring is a part of contract inspection, except that it focuses on
hose attributes of the Contractor’s performance that bear on the incentive objectives. The purpose of performance
monitoring is to obtain accurate information about the Contractor’s achievement of the incentive objectives. This
process supports (1) the TDO’s evaluation of overall performance and (2) the provision of feedback to the
Contractor.

HDEC02-04-R-0002
Page 44 of 71

The ATB Chairperson will notify the ATB members 15 calendar days before the end of each interim evaluation
period. ATB members will provide completed evaluation reports to the ATB Chairperson within 15 calendar days
after the six-month evaluation period ends. The ATB Chairperson will determine the interim evaluation rating and
will provide this information in writing to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will advise the
Contractor of his interim rating by letter, to include strengths and weaknesses.
(d) Final Award Term Evaluations. Input for final evaluations will follow the same procedures and time frames as
he interim award term evaluations. The ATB Chairperson will evaluate ATB member input as well as Contractor
input, if provided (see paragraph (e) below), and will provide a recommendation to the TDO regarding the award
erm decision. The TDO’s decision will be provided to the ATB Chairman in writing, who will in turn pass the
information to the Contracting Officer. If the decision is favorable, the Contracting Officer will execute a unilateral
modification to extend the contract. The copy of the modification will be sent to the Contractor, accompanied by a
letter from the Contracting Officer notifying of the award term decision. The letter will include a summary of the
strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor’s performance observed during the period. If the decision is unfavorable,
he Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor in writing, providing detailed supporting rationale.
If the Contractor has not earned an award term by the end of the second year of performance under the contract, the
Government may declare the award-term incentive void. The ATB will provide a recommendation to the TDO
regarding rescission of successive award terms. If the TDO decides to rescind future award terms, the Contractor
will be notified in writing by the Contracting Officer.
(e) Contractor Self-Evaluation. At the option of the Contractor, the contractor may (1) request an opportunity to
address the ATB in person with a self-evaluation or the company’s performance, or (2) submit to the ACO, within 15
calendar days after the end of each award-term evaluation period, a brief written self-evaluation of its performance
for that period. If the Contractor requests an opportunity to address the ATB in person, the person addressing the
ATB must be employed in a management position within the Contractor’s organization. The Contractor’s selfevaluation, in the format presented, will be used in the ATB evaluation of the Contractor’s performance during this
period. Costs associated with the Contractor’s efforts in this regard will not be reimbursed under the contract.
(f) Completion of Evaluation. The estimated time for the completion of the Government’s evaluation is
approximately 30 days after the conclusion of the evaluation period.
5.0 AWARD TERM PLAN CHANGE PROCEDURE
Changes to the Award Term Plan evaluation criteria will be made by revising Appendix B. Contractor requested
changes to the Award Term Plan shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer not later than 90 calendar days prior
o the start of the evaluation period. The Contracting Officer will forward the requested changes to the ATB chair
and board members for coordination. Upon review, the ATB will forward a recommendation to accept or reject the
changes to the TDO.
All changes to the Award Term Plan will be negotiated with the Contractor. Where the Government desires a
change to the Award Term Plan and a mutual agreement cannot be reached by the end of the evaluation period, the
Government and Contractor agree that Alternate Disputes Resolution procedures will be used.

AWARD TERM PLAN FOR IN-STORE BAKERY OPERATIONS
## APPENDIX B
INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CRITERIA, RATINGS, AND STANDARDS

EXCELLENT –
The contractor’s performance merits an award term extension when it reaches the level of excellent performance.
The level of excellent performance is identified in the Performance Assessment Plan. Performance in this area
consistently exceeds contractual requirements, objectives or expectations to the patron’s and the Government’s
benefit. The Contractor consistently provides quality and responsive services, high levels of customer satisfaction,
proactive prevention of complaints, problems, and issues, and quick and effective problem resolutions. Complaints,
issues, and problems are minor and infrequent. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being
assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor were
highly effective. Examples include:
• Timely response and completion of all patron requested services with fewer than 2 valid customer
complaints at the location covered by the contract for the period evaluated.
• More than the prescribed percentage of patron savings is provided on all high volume identified
core items.
• A minimum of .25% more than the sales increase as prescribed in the Merchandising Plan is being
accomplished.
• The variety, quality, special orders, promotional items, and product mix provided are providing high
levels of patron satisfaction.

ACCEPTABLE Performance, for the most part, meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or subelement being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor appear or
were satisfactory. Examples include:
• Timely response and completion of all patron requested services with fewer than 3 valid customer
complaints at the location covered by the contract for each six-month period evaluated.
• Nothing above the prescribed percentage of patron savings on all high volume core items was
provided. There were no more than five verifiable instances of lower prices same or similar items
sold in the local commuting area for the location covered by the contract for each six-month period
evaluated.
• Sales increase amount as prescribed in the Merchandising Plan is met.
• The variety, quality, special orders, promotional items, and product mix provided are considered
adequate but fail to result in high levels of patron satisfaction.

HDEC02-04-R-0002
Page 47 of 71

UNACCEPTABLE Performance did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The
contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the
Contractor’s corrective actions appear, or are, ineffective. Examples include:





Response and completion of patron requested services resulted in 3 or more customer complaints at the
location covered by the contract for each six-month period evaluated.
The prescribed percentage of patron savings on all high volume core items was not met.
No increase in sales, as prescribed in the Merchandising Plan, for the period evaluated.
Customer satisfaction levels with the variety, quality, special orders, promotional items, and product mix
are low.

AWARD TERM PLAN FOR IN-STORE BAKERY OPERATIONS
## APPENDIX C
## ORGANIZATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES

ORGANIZATIONThe award-term organization consists of the Term Determining Official (TDO) Award Term Board (ATB),
Chairman with ATB members and other advisory members, as required.
RESPONSIBILITIES –
Contracting Officer (CO): The CO issues a unilateral modification to the contract extending the term of the contract,
per TDO decision. The CO enters the Contractor’s Award Term Evaluations into the Defense Commissary Agency’s
Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System.
Term Determining Official (TDO): The TDO approves the award term plan and any significant changes. Examples
of significant changes include changing evaluation criteria or adjusting the characteristics of levels of performance to
redirect the Contractor’s emphasis to areas needing improvement. The TDO reviews the recommendation(s) of the
ATB Chairman, considers all pertinent data, and determines whether the Contractor earned an award for each
evaluation period.
Award Term Board (ATB): An ATB, composed of selected technical and administrative personnel from the Defense
Commissary Agency, evaluates the Contractor’s performance as it relates to the criteria listed in this plan. The ATB
Chairman decides the contractor’s interim evaluation rating. Within 30 calendar days after the end of the final
evaluation period, the ATB Chairman submits the formal evaluation report to the TDO. The report includes a
narrative of each element evaluated supporting the recommended rating assigned. The ATB may recommend
changes to this plan to the TDO.
Award Term Board Chairperson: The ATB Chairperson serves as the focal point for execution of the Award Term
Plan. The Chairperson, and other ATB members, as needed, briefs the TDO on recommended earned award terms
and the Contractor’s overall performance and recommends significant award term plan changes to the TDO. The
Chairperson coordinates the administrative actions during the award term process, including (1) receiving,
processing and distributing evaluation reports from all required sources; (2) scheduling board meetings and
briefings; (3) accomplishing other actions required to ensure the smooth operation of the Award Term Board.
Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE): Each commissary covered by this contract will appoint a QAE. The QAE’s
evaluate the Contractor’s performance specific to each location for each interim period of performance in
consideration for an award term. The QAE is responsible for complying with the Quality Assurance Surveillance
Plan, and any specific instructions of the ACO, in monitoring, evaluating and assessing contractor performance in
assigned areas.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contrac
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state
or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne
by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by
he wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in
accordance with the following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the
actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and
maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and
subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a
bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or
he furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse
all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week
(or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms
furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and
dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatmen
such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to mee
he cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the
work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform
maintenance costs.
** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **
Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993,
as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise
indicated. This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of
Documents, at 202-783-3238, or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents,

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard
Form 1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which
is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the
work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such
unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage
determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary
wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming
process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of
contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed
classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6
(C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a
separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a
class(es) is to be conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in
order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for
each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed

HDEC02-04-R-0002
Page 58 of 71
wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of
he authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no
authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be
submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted
class(es) of employees performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a
report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the
Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Departmen
of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies,
or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer,
or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to
process the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the
contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond
paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Ac
Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job

## FACILITY DESCRIPTION LAYOUT
## FOR SCOTT AFB COMMISSARY IN THE MIDWEST REGION
## BAKERY OPERATIONS

NOTE: Facility Layouts Are Provided as a guide and are not intended as an accurate blueprint. The
Government Does Not Guarantee The Accuracy Of The Information Provided. A Vendor Site Visit To The
Commissary Is Recommended.

HELPFUL HINTS FROM THE SEVEN STEPS TEAM:
(1) Expected outcomes are good, but use market research to ensure their feasibility; and (2) use market research to
determine whether contractors operating bakeries are more efficient if they provide the items now listed in
Attachment 7.
