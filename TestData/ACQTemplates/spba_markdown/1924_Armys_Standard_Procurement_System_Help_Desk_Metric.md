Definitions:
• Response time is defined as the time it takes for an Authorized Caller to be contacted by the first SPS Help Desk
analyst who attempts to troubleshoot the Service Request.
• Resolution time will be calculated as the time required by the SPS Help Desk to identify a correct solution to an
Authorized Caller’s Service Request, minus any time the SPS Help Desk is awaiting a response from the Authorized
Caller or a 3rd party vendor Help Desk support staff. Resolution time commences when a Service Request is opened.

o resolve the Service Request.
• Accountability for resolution and response times will be suspended during the times the SPS Help Desk is not in
operation (2100 Friday through 2100 Sunday). Work on an issue will be cease upon closure of the SPS Help Desk for
a given day regardless of issue severity.
