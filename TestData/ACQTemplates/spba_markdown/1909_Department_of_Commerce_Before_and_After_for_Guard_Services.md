AFTER: Statement of Objectives

I. BACKGROUND
The (Agency) requires uniformed protective security services for its headquarters (HQ) building,
24x7x365. This building is located at (Address). The demand for highly qualified, highly
skilled personnel working within the HQ Building is a daily requirement; these offices house the
Secretary, Deputy, and Sub-cabinet members. The office hours are from 0600 to 2000 with peak
hours from 0800 to 1700. The building has a high rate of public use and many (agency) and non
(agency) functions use the mail lobby, auditorium, and conference rooms. These functions are
open to anyone, including foreign nationals. At any given time, 16 fixed and roving posts mus
be manned, along with coverage of the command center (approximately 22 contractor employees
at all times).
II. PROJECT SUMMARY
A. The (Agency) expects the Contractor to provide security services for the HQ Building,
24x7x365. This service will provide a daily deterrent against unauthorized, illegal, or potentially
life-threatening activities directed toward (agency) employees, visitors, information, programs,
property, and the like.

C. Because of changing conditions within the (Agency) facilities, it may be necessary to
occasionally alter scheduled start and stop times to meet security needs or to request additional
special police officers (SPO). Any Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)
change will be at no increase in contract price provided the resultant project manager working
hours do not exceed 8 hours per day Monday through Friday.
