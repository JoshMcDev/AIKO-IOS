SUBJECT:

Using Performance-Based Acquisition to Meet Program Needs –
Performance Goals, Guidance, and Training

Performance-based acquisition (PBA) is a results-oriented acquisition strategy used to
achieve innovative solutions in agency programs. The purpose of this memorandum is to
recommend appropriate PBA performance goals and identify PBA learning assets, including
useful guides and training opportunities, to ensure this acquisition strategy is used effectively.
PBA is also discussed in the report issued by the Acquisition Advisory Panel (referred to as the
Panel), established under the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003. The Panel’s repor
includes specific recommendations to improve the effectiveness and appropriate use of PBA,
and this memorandum discusses our plan for implementing some of the Panel’s
recommendations.
Performance Goals
The PBA performance goal is used to measure agencies’ use of PBA, and agencies
should use this goal to encourage the acquisition workforce, including program and projec
managers, to employ PBA methods on service acquisitions. In fiscal year (FY) 2006, agencies
were required to apply PBA methods on 40 percent or more of their eligible service actions
over $25,000, to include contracts, task orders, modifications, and options, as measured in
dollars. According to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), most agencies met or
exceeded the goal, awarding over 45 percent of their eligible service contract actions.
Agencies should continue to report PBA actions accurately in FPDS and should review the
new report format to assess PBA performance goals, available at https://www.fpds.gov/.
In view of last year’s success, agencies are encouraged to increase their use of PBA and
apply PBA methods on 45 percent of their eligible service actions over $25,000 for FY 2007,
o include contracts, task orders, modifications, and options, as measured in dollars. At a
minimum, agencies are expected to meet the PBA performance goals established in the
agency-wide PBA Management Plans for FY 2007 through FY 2011. This allows for the
flexibility of individual agency assessments as recommended in the Panel’s report. Please
ensure that your agency plan reflects the most current information. If necessary, provide an
update within 30 days to Julia Wise at jwise@omb.eop.gov. Later this fiscal year, the Office
of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) will issue a separate memorandum highlighting the
“best practices” identified in the agency plans.

Guidance
The Seven Steps to Performance-Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) Guide has a new
Web site link at http://acquisition.gov/sevensteps. This online guide includes PBA regulations,
policy, and guidance. Most importantly, it includes vetted examples, templates, and an “Ask
he Expert” feature that allows questions to be asked and addressed by a PBA expert within
24 hours. This guide should be visible on agency policy Web sites to ensure the acquisition
workforce has immediate access to PBA information. Agencies are encouraged to send good
PBA solicitation and/or contract documents and their PBA questions to
SevenStepstoPBSA.Feedback@gsa.gov.
The OFPP-led PBA Interagency Working Group meets monthly and the members are
listed on the OFPP Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/index_pbsa.html.
The group will work on the following tasks that are consistent with some of the Panel’s PBA
recommendations:
1. develop an illustrative guide or decision tree to help agencies determine when to use
PBA;
2. establish a matrix of contract performance incentives (both monetary and nonmonetary) appropriate for various contract vehicles when using the PBA strategy;
3. develop a “Best Practices Guide on Performance Measures” to improve the
development and selection of performance standards for PBA contracts;
4. develop a checklist that reflects how well an acquisition works within the basic
elements of the Seven Steps to PBSA Guide; and
5. review and evaluate PBA samples and examples to incorporate in the Seven Steps to
PBSA Guide.
Training
Effective training is crucial to the successful implementation of PBA, and opportunities
include online and classroom courses, workshops, seminars and conferences. PBA training
should be completed by senior managers, program/project managers, requirements personnel,
quality assurance specialists, Contracting Officer’s Representatives, Contracting Officer’s
Technical Representatives, subject matter experts and contracting officials involved in a PBA.
Agency acquisition workforce policy should include these PBA training requirements at the
appropriate level for all members of the acquisition workforce to ensure PBA principles are
applied properly on service acquisitions. The OFPP April 25, 2007, memorandum, The
Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers, emphasizes PBA
raining requirements for program and project managers at various certification levels. The
OFPP memorandum is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/workforce/
fed_acq_cert_042507.pdf.
The Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and the Defense Acquisition University (DAU)
offer several PBA training opportunities. The FAI offers a three-day workshop on PBA
designed as a just-in-time solution for acquisition teams from various agencies. The
participants are encouraged to bring their current PBA documents and are given a chance to
refine these documents in the training class. The training is offered at various locations around
he country and is generally available through the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund.

Students should register online at www.fai.gov. Questions about this training should be
directed to FAI student services at 703-805-2300.
The DAU offers a four and a half day classroom course entitled “Mission Focused
Service Acquisitions,” course number ACQ265, and two online learning modules:
1) Performance-Based Services Acquisitions, CLC 013; and 2) Work Breakdown Structure,
CLM 013. Additionally, a PBA Community of Practice, available at https://acc.dau.mil/pba,
includes the above PBA training information as well as other training opportunities, policy and
guidance, tools and related links such as the Acquisition Center of Excellence for Services
Community of Practice, available at https://acc.dau.mil/ace. Additionally, many private sector
firms offer PBA training. Information about these training resources is available on
http://acquisition.gov/SevenSteps.
The information provided in this memorandum should prove useful to improving the
knowledge and effective application of PBA within your agency. We will continue to work
with you to improve the PBA guidance and will keep you abreast of new PBA training
opportunities and best practices. Please ensure wide distribution of this memorandum to your
agency’s acquisition personnel. Questions may be directed to Julia Wise at (202)395-7561 or
jwise@omb.eop.gov.
