PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

A.1

INTRODUCTION

A.1.1 The title of this PWS is the Contract Medical Disability Examination
Project. Public Law 104-275 authorized the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to
conduct a limited pilot program to contract for medical examinations from non-VA
medical sources at up to 10 VA regional offices (VARO). The pilot commenced on May
1, 1998 and will terminate with the current contractor on April 30, 2003. An expiration
date for this authority was not specified; therefore, the VA is planning to select a
contractor for another five-year period to begin on May 1, 2003, through April 30, 2008.
Performance will constantly be measured. The goal of this and other concurrent VA
initiatives is to quantitatively improve the overall level of service provided the nation's
veteran population. The volume of disability examinations is approximately 50,000 to
60,000 per year for the 10 regional offices and 22 Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)
sites.
A.1.2 Participating VAROs currently include: Greater Atlanta, including North
and Central Georgia (including BDD sites Ft. Benning, Ft. Gordon, Ft. Stewart); Boston;
Houston and San Antonio, Texas (including Brooks AFB, Corpus Christi, Ft. Sam
Houston, Lackland AFB, Randolph AFB, and Sheppard AFB); Greater Los Angeles;
Muskogee (to include Altus AFB, Ft. Sill, Sheppard AFB, Tinker AFB and Vance AFB);
Roanoke (to include Portsmouth); Salt Lake City (to include Hill AFB); San Diego
(Riverside county and Camp Pendleton); Seattle and surrounding areas (including
Bremerton Naval Station), and the Spokane area; and Winston-Salem (Coastal and
Mountain areas of North Carolina and Camp Lejeune, Ft. Bragg, Pope AFB, and
Seymour-Johnson AFB). A specific portion of the examinations within the jurisdiction of
hese VAROs will be dedicated to the contractor. These locations are subject to change
as required by the VA in which 60-90 days ramp-up time will be provided to the
contractor to hire and train additional personnel.
B.1

BACKGROUND

B.1.1 The VA annually administers, through the Veterans Benefits
Administration (VBA), a compensation and pension (C&P) program valued a
approximately $22 billion in annual benefit payments. Benefits are paid to veterans, their
dependents, and their survivors. Entitlement determinations for disability compensation
(based on disabilities deemed to be service related) and disability pension (needs based
entitlement for wartime veterans with non-service related disabilities) are made by
disability panels located at 57 VAROs. Generally, jurisdiction for compensation and

1

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

original pension payments corresponds with state boundaries, but with jurisdiction
divided between three VAROs for California and two VAROs each for New York,
Pennsylvania, and Texas. A VARO located in San Juan has jurisdiction for veterans
residing in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. A VARO located in Manila has
jurisdiction over Philippine cases.
B.1.2 Annually, the VA receives over 120,000 original disability compensation
claims, over 390,000 reopened compensation claims, and over 30,000 pension claims.
Examinations for disability determination purposes are conducted at local VA medical
centers (VAMC) based upon VARO requests. More than 300,000 are performed
annually. Examinations are required to support original disability determinations, claims
for increased benefits, appellate reviews, and for review of disabilities considered likely
o improve.

Exhibit No. 2
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
For Contract XXXXX
I.

Objective

This plan provides a quality surveillance strategy for disability examinations performed for the US
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). The primary intent of the plan is to
provide a basis for the contracting officer's technical representative's (COTR) evaluation of performance quality.
Oversight of contractor performance will assure contract quality and consistency of services provided to VBA and
he veteran. The plan will also afford the COTR a proactive mechanism to preclude major deficiencies in
performance and provide input for annual past performance evaluations.
II.

III.

Performance Indicators (Measures)
a.

Timeliness. The COTR will determine whether the contractor has consistently satisfied the acceptable
level of performance per contractual requirements. The timeliness standard for completing
examination requests is specified in C.1.11.

b.

Quality. The COTR will determine whether the contractor has consistently satisfied the acceptable
level of performance for documenting examination reports per VA examination workshee
specifications. The quality standard for ensuring that all examination reports are compliant with the
VA examination worksheets is specified in C.1.12.

c.

Report Corrections. The COTR will determine whether the contractor has consistently satisfied the
acceptable level of performance for returning insufficient reports to VA in a timely manner. The
standard for returning insufficient examination reports to VA is in C.1.13.

d.

Customer Satisfaction. The COTR will determine whether the contractor has consistently satisfied the
acceptable level of performance for ensuring that veterans are seen by physicians within one hour of
appointment time, and that veterans' are satisfied with the contractor's services. The standards for
customer satisfaction are found in C.1.3, C.1.6, C.1.8, C.1.14, C.1.17, and C.1.18.

Evaluation Methods

The COTR will perform evaluations based on the indicators in paragraph II of this plan. The COTR will
initiate the following surveillance techniques.
a.

Random inspections. The COTR will perform random visual inspections at least once a year at all
of the contractor's sites that perform functions for VA under this contract. A minimum of one site
will be included in each inspection, unless specific areas have been targeted for surveillance. A
argeted area is one that has received multiple complaints or that needs special attention by the
contractor for any reason. The COTR will inform the contractor of any discrepancies found
against performance standards. The COTR will maintain records of all inspections and provide a
copy of any report to the contractor.

b.

Quarterly quality reviews. The VBA Medical Director will conduct a quarterly quality review of a
random sample of the contractor's completed examination reports based on the requirements of the
VA examination worksheets. The VBA Medical Director will share the results of the reviews with
he COTR and contractor and be available to the contractor to explain the findings with the
contractor's employees.

c.

Veterans Examination Request Information System (VERIS). The COTR will generate quarterly
reports for quality and timeliness from the VBA Intranet tool that is used by rating specialists to
enter examination requests and record timeliness and quality information. This tool measures the

11

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

timeliness based on date that the request is actually sent to the contractor, to the date it is logged in
as complete and available to VBA. The contractor provides the completion date to be entered into
he application, but the completed examination report must be delivered (or posted) to VA on tha
date.
d.

Customer Satisfaction. An annual customer satisfaction survey is performed. An independent
contractor will be responsible for receiving the completed questionnaires and tabulating the results
for the COTR's review. Quarterly results will also be provided to the contractor so that any
customer satisfaction area requiring attention can be addressed by the contractor. Veterans'
responses to these questions will become the basis for the COTR to determine if incentives or
deductions are to be applied according to the ALPs.

Questions/Answers

CONTRACT MEDICAL DISABILITY EXAMS
## RFP
QUESTIONS/ANSWERS

GENERAL ACQUISITION OUESTIONS:

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS:
1. What kind of e-mail system would be in use by the VA for the project?
The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) uses Microsoft Exchange 4.0
electronic mail system as its "departmental" messaging system. We have a Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) gateway in operation which permits electronic
messages to be sent from VBA personnel to external mail boxes on the Internet and
visa versa. At the present time, there are no security measures in place to protec
he privacy of data transmitted via electronic mail. For this project, secure
ransmission of data is necessary due to the private nature of the data.
2. Is it MIME compliant for attachments?
Yes, according to Microsoft's Technet, Exchange 4.0 supports Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) and is MIME-compliant.
3. Do you expect WAN (Wide Area Network) access to our scheduling system?
Yes, all participating VBA Regional Offices will need on-line access to the vendor's
scheduling system and exam request facilities. The vendor mus
present a fully functional connectivity solution that includes all access components.
The VBA has an internal use WAN, called the Integrated Data Communications
Utility (IDCU), which is a private, packet switched network.
4. If yes, how many simultaneous users?
VBA estimates 530 potential total users over the life of the contract. About 300 users
(all current rating specialists, hearing officers, and a station project coordinator a
each site) will require access from their desktop in the initial pilot. We estimate
about 50 simultaneous users during peak production hours.

13

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

5. If you desire modem access, how many simultaneous users?
VBA does not require modems as a connection strategy and it is not preferred;
however, it is recognized as a reasonable approach to the requirement. If modems
are proposed, then the vendor must provide each user with a modem or access to a
modem pool at the VBA site as well as the vendor's host site. The requirement is
hat VBA personnel must be able to conduct business with the contract provider
without having to leave their desktop workstation and go to another workstation.
Of the estimated 300 Rating Specialist and Decision Review Officers who will
participate in the study, we project that there will be about 50 simultaneous users
during production hours.
6. Would you prefer WEB browser access with password protection? Do the claims staff use a
browser, and if so, what type and version?
VBA prefers a WEB based technical solution. Password protection and encrypted
ransmission of data is necessary to ensure the privacy of data. The VBA standard
browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 in conjunction with Microsoft TCP/IP
for Windows 95 and Softronic's Softerm 4.00.02 for terminal emulation.
7. How will the examination requests be sent to the contractor?
VBA rating specialists use an Intranet tool called VERIS (Veterans Examination
Request Information System). All new requests are identified as status "1" and are
rolled up by the application every morning, encrypted and e-mailed to the
contractor over the Internet in a text file format. A back up plan will also need to
be developed by the contractor and VBA when Internet e-mail is not available due
o technical difficulties.
8. Is toll-free access expected for Veterans to call on us?
Yes. We would expect toll-free service for veterans to contact the contractor with
questions pertaining to their scheduled examinations during normal business hours.
9. Would the VA make calls to us at their expense or also expect toll-free service?
No. VA calls will be at government expense.
10. Would most communication with the VA for scheduling purposes be performed via
computer, phone or fax?
Routine scheduling would be by computer.

14

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

BILLING:
11. How many examinations will be included in each order?
It depends. Daily examination requests have been as low as 200 and as high as 400
due to VBA's workload peaks. We would expect this trend to remain for at least the
next two years, but would not expect it to drop to below 200 per day.
12. In what intervals or batches should examinations be billed?
Invoices shall be submitted monthly or bi-monthly to the VBA COTR and projec
manager in an electronic format.
13. Do you have sample invoices that can be furnished?
No.
14. What sort of supporting documentation would accompany a fund transfer?
The paying office sends the transfer to your bank along with the invoice number,
contract number, and dollar amount. The bank notifies their customer, i.e. you. I
was recommended that you talk to the ACB coordinator at your bank to find out the
exact details of how they handle it.
CONSULTANT RECRUITING/SCHEDULING/TRAINING and OPERATIONS:
15. Can you provide the most common worksheets requested?
Yes. Below is the volume of the twelve most common worksheets requested during
he period May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002:

16. What is the percentage of exams that require more than one physician?
With the exception of specialist examinations (for which separate billing is
provided) a single physician should be able to complete all required examination
worksheets.
17. Please clarify what percentage of examination requests are multi-exams.
Each examination requests generally equates to 1.3 examinations to complete the
request.
18. How many medical records in pages are provided on average?
Claims folder (original) containing available medical records will be provided.
Volume of medical records will range significantly depending on circumstances of
he claim including treatment history, and whether the examination is for an
original claim, reopened claim or appellate issue. Currently, claims folders are sen
for at least psychiatric evaluations, requests for medical opinions, appellate review
and most requests for specialist reviews. Some claims folders can be several inches
hick, but only the medical records, and other pertinent documentation, will need to
be scanned.
19. Will the records be in paper form, microfiche, or electronic?
Records will be provided in paper form (originals requiring return to the sending
station).
20. How long are records to be retained?
If the question refers to VA records submitted for review, they should be returned
as soon as the examiner has completed his report but no later than five (5) days after
completion of the examination report. If the question refers to how long the
Contractor should maintain an examination report and supporting data, the answer
is a minimum of one year.
21. Are the VA records that are to be forwarded to the contractor the original records? If so,
does the VA or contractor assume responsibility if they are lost in the mail? Also, following the
examinations, is the VA or the contractor the custodian of the examination reports?
Yes, original records will be furnished. The contractor would not be responsible for
records lost in the mail. However, protecting records in the contractor's possession
including the privacy of those records would be considered a contractor
responsibility, and failure to do so would be considered performance deficiency.
The examination reports must be maintained by the contractor for a period of one
year. The VA will print the reports received, associate the report with the veteran's

16

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

claims folder where it will permanently reside. The contractor is not considered the
custodian of the record. The VA is the custodian and any requests directed to the
contractor for claimant information should be directed to the regional office of
record for processing.
22. Are the tests that are included in the exam to be performed prior to the exam? Is the
examining physician expected to review test results such as X-rays?
Scheduling of tests will be left to contractor discretion. In some instances a
determination of required test may not be made until after the physician has
conducted an examination, but yes, the physician's findings and diagnosis should
include a review of test results.
23. If further testing is required, is the patient to return to the examining physician for further
review?
As needed only (often a physician should be able to complete his report with review
of the test results), but if further physician review (examination) is required, i
should be by the same physician if possible.
24. Are any of the tests to be performed at VA facilities?
No.
25. You ask that 7 days be allowed for scheduling. Do you have a window that you prefer?
The veteran must be given timely notification of the scheduled appointment.
26. From compliance and incentive standpoint, does the clock start from the time of the first call
for an examination by the VA, the date of the exam, or when labs are finished? (Realize that if
an exam is for example scheduled in 14 days, and lab/X-rays are required, that to meet the
optimum time frame, there is very little time to produce the report. Certain studies such as MRI's,
cardiac studies and others might not be able to be scheduled the same day, and require several
days for results.)
The clock starts from the time the contractor receives the daily file containing the
examination requests until the date the VA receives the completed examination
report. We recognized that in some instances examinations may take longer to
process and allow for that by measuring based on AVERAGE processing days.
27. Are we expected to notify the Veterans of the examination by mail, phone or both? How is
it currently done?

17

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

The contractor may use mail, phone, e-mail or a combination of all to notify the
veteran of the examination date and time. We prefer a combination so that "no
shows" can be kept to a minimum.
28. Should no-shows and late cancels be automatically rescheduled? With or without VA
knowledge and/or consent?
One reschedule is allowed. If the veteran is a no show, and does not contact the
contractor the day after the scheduled appointment to request a reschedule, then the
regional office must be notified by e-mail that the veteran was a no show and no
further attempt to contact the veteran is necessary. However, if the veteran does
contact the contractor and request to be rescheduled, then one reschedule is
allowed. The contractor may also "code" this request as a "reschedule" so that the
examination request cycle time is not counted against the contractor for
accommodating the veteran.
29. If a veteran calls in advance to rearrange an examination within a reasonable period (e.g. one
week), is this permissible?
Yes.
30. Are we expected to determine service connectedness as well as diagnosis?
No. The determination of service connection is the responsibility of the VBA rating
specialist. You may however, be asked to offer specific opinions such as "are
current symptoms related to condition [specified] documented during military
service?" Or, "is the condition as least as likely or not related to service?" (Service
medical records and available post service treatment records would be provided for
review.) Or, "is there a causal relationship between a service connected left knee
condition and current low back complaints?"
31. Please discuss the nature of the disability exams; philosophy, reference material used by
physicians, length of exam, amount of narrative, etc.
Disability examinations are to be approached in a positive manner. When issues
arise where reasonable doubt exists, that doubt should be decided in the veteran's
favor. The examination in addition to etiological, anatomical, pathological,
laboratory and prognostic data required for ordinary medical classification, should
fully describe the effects of disability upon the person's ordinary activity.
The basic guideline for examinations is the Compensation and Pension Examination
Worksheets. The length of examination should be governed by the time required to
obtain the information specified in the relevant worksheet, including appropriate
history and complaints. Concise narrative, including required findings, and any
other information directly pertinent to

18

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

the issue is preferred. Unnecessarily redundant or expansive narratives should be
avoided.
32. If the veteran asks for a copy of the report, should it be provided?
No. The veteran should be advised to obtain a copy from the VA regional office
handling the veteran's claim.
33. If a release signed by the veteran and/or subpoena is received for the report, should it be
provided with or without the VA knowledge and/or consent?
No. The VA is the custodian of the record and all requests should be forwarded to
he regional office of record for response.
34. Should the consultants be specifically proscribed as to offering treatment for the veterans
hat they examine?
If treatment is necessary, then the regional office should be notified so tha
reatment can be arranged at the closest VA medical center or clinic. If urgent care
is needed, then a referral can be made with notification to VA for follow up.
35. Do these examinations become part of the Veteran's medical record file?
They become a permanent part of the Veteran's VA claims folder. They will be
available for appellate review by the Board of Veterans Appeal (BVA), U.S. Cour
for Veterans Appeals, and regional office review in conjunction with any future
reviews (either based on a reopened claim or other future review). They will not be
routinely forwarded to VA's Veterans Health Administration unless a VA medical
center requests a copy of the report.
36. While examination reports are to be conveyed electronically, does the VA desire a hard copy
as well to be mailed?
No.
37. Copies of labs, photos, X-rays and other studies would be mailed separately from the
electronically submitted reports. Is this what is expected?
No. It is preferred that they be transmitted in .pdf format along with the
examination report electronically. The actual x-rays are not routinely required; the
narrative report (reading) is sufficient, unless otherwise specified.
38. Is there an average size in words or pages of a report for given specialties?

19

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

No. We seek concise reports that convey all the required information per the
examination worksheets.
39. Do you have some sample reports that demonstrate your concept of excellence?
No. We believe the Compensation and Pension Examination Worksheets are the
best "guide" to the information necessary to present an excellent examination
report.
ADMINISTRATIVE and OTHER:
40. What are the VA's current internal costs per examination? Do these include laboratory and
x-ray?
The internal cost of conducting an examination for disability evaluation purposes is
not yet available.
41. What are the main problems currently faced with the internal system now in place?
Current problems include uneven examination quality and processing timeliness.
42. Do you intend to increase the size of the contract during the course of it?
Not at the present time.
43. Does the government anticipate an immediate full caseload from the ten regional office and
heir Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) sites as of May 1, 2003?
Yes. The contractor should be ready to take the full caseload by this date.
44. Will the government provide relevant training materials and/or collaborative consultation to
assist us in developing proper training on the VA system, and its policies and requirements?
Yes. Existing materials developed to assist VA physicians will be reviewed and
adapted for this purpose. Additional information required to introduce physicians
and others to the VA, our programs, and resources will be developed and provided.
45. Do you have any estimates of the percent of veterans who are entitled to and who claim
ravel allowance to attend examinations, and the average cost for those who are reimbursed?
Most veterans would be eligible for travel allowance for attending examinations.
The average cost will depend greatly on a contractor's ability to schedule
examinations relatively close to the veteran's home of record, since payments are
based on rate per mile traveled.

20

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

46. How many VA staff would we be likely to interact with on a regular basis?
Each of the ten regional offices has one examination coordinator who is the primary
contact for the contractor for inquiries and clarification as it pertains to the daily
workload file. In addition, a VBA project manager is assigned, as well as a COTR
who the contractor will be in routine contact.
47. Do hearing exams have to be performed with all general medical examinations?
No. A specific audiology examination would only be required if hearing loss was
specified as a condition to be examined, or if during the general clinical assessment,
hearing impairment was established or suspected. Hearing examinations must be
performed by a licensed audiologist using the Maryland CNC test.
48. What percentage of non-specialist exams require a specialist exam?
For examinations in areas other than psychiatry, dental, ophthalmology, audiology,
and neurology, specialty requests will be the exception and not the norm. While a
specialist will not be required for all neurological issues, specialists will be required
in this area more often than not. However, for example, when checking for
peripheral neuropathy as a complication of diabetes, a specialist will not generally
be required. Usually, in other areas, specialist examinations will be requested when
a case has been appealed and a specialist examination is directed by the Board of
Veterans Appeals, or when there is conflicting medical evidence of record which
requires resolution. Specific percentages have not been documented.
49. Is additional medical opinion/recommendation such as apportionment, causation and return
o work status required in each report, and if so, is it included in the unit price.
Routine information required in each worksheet will be included in the examination
price. Medical opinions, questions that the physician can respond to based on
examination of the veteran, not requiring extensive review of medical records will
also be included in the basic exam price. A separate charge may be added for
specific requested "independent medical opinions" requiring review of the available
medical records and a formal written opinion including citation of the pertinen
facts found on the medical record review.
50. The contractor must bear the cost of postage for the customer survey cards. Do they have to
be mailed via first class postage to the independent contractor?
No, as long as the cards can be received by the independent contractor within a twoweek period once placed into the US Postal Service system by the veteran.

Compensation and Pension Examination Worksheets

GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION
Name:

SSN:

Date of Exam:

C-number:

Place of Exam:
Narrative: This is a comprehensive base-line or screening examination for all body systems, not just specific
conditions claimed by the veteran. It is often the initial post-discharge examination of a veteran requested by the
Compensation and Pension Service for disability compensation purposes. As a screening examination, it is no
meant to elicit the detailed information about specific conditions that is necessary for rating purposes. Therefore,
all claimed conditions, and any found or suspected conditions that were not claimed, should be addressed by
referring to and following all appropriate worksheets, in addition to this one, to assure that the examination
for each condition provides information adequate for rating purposes. This does not require that a medical
specialist conduct examinations based on other worksheets, except in the case of vision and hearing problems,
mental disorders, or especially complex or unusual problems. VISION, HEARING, AND MENTAL DISORDER
EXAMINATIONS MUST BE CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIST. The examiner may request any additional
studies or examinations needed for proper diagnosis and evaluation (see other worksheets for guidance). All
important negatives should be reported. The regional office may also request a general medical examination as
evidence for nonservice-connected disability pension claims or for claimed entitlement to individual unemployability
benefits in service-connected disability compensation claims. Barring unusual problems, examinations for pension
should generally be adequate if only this general worksheet is followed.
A. Review of Medical Records: Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.
B. Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
1. Discuss: Whether an injury or disease that is found occurred during active service, before active service, or
after active service. To the extent possible, describe the circumstances, dates, specific injury or disease tha
occurred, treatment, follow-up, and residuals. If the injury or disease occurred before active service,
describe any worsening of residuals due to being in military service. Describe current symptoms and
reatment.
2. Occupational history (for pension and individual unemployability claims): Obtain the name and address of
employers (list most current first), type of occupation, employment dates, and wages for last 12 months. If
any time was lost from work in the past 12-month period, please describe the reason and extent of time lost.
3. Describe details of current treatment, conditions being treated, and side effects of treatment.
4. Describe all surgery and hospitalizations in and after service with approximate dates.
5. If a malignant neoplasm is or was present, provide:
a. Date of confirmed diagnosis.
b. Date of the last surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, radiation, or other therapeutic
procedure.

11. Chest: Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation. Describe respiratory symptoms and effect on daily
activities, e.g., how far the veteran can walk, how many flights of stairs veterans can climb. If a respiratory
condition is claimed or suspected, refer to appropriate worksheet(s). Most respiratory conditions will
require PFT’s, including post-bronchodilation studies. Describe in detail any treatment for pulmonary
disease.
12. Breast: Describe masses, scars, nipple discharge, skin abnormalities. Give date of last mammogram, if any.
Describe any breast surgery (with approximate date) and residuals.
13. Cardiovascular : NOTE: If there is evidence of a cardiovascular disease, or one is claimed, refer to
appropriate worksheet(s).
a. Record pulse, quality of heart sounds, abnormal heart sounds, arrhythmias. Describe symptoms
and treatment for any cardiovascular condition, including peripheral arterial and venous disease.
Give NYHA classification of heart disease. A determination of METs by exercise testing may be
required for certain cardiovascular conditions, and an estimation of METS may be required if
exercise testing cannot be conducted for medical reasons. (See the cardiovascular worksheets for
further guidance.)
b. Describe the status of peripheral vessels and pulses. Describe edema, stasis pigmentation or
eczema, ulcers, or other skin or nail abnormalities. Describe varicose veins, including extent to
which any resulting edema is relieved by elevation of extremity. Examine for evidence of
residuals of cold injury when indicated. See and follow special cold injury examination workshee
if there is a history of cold exposure in service and the special cold injury examination has no
been previously done.
c. BLOOD PRESSURE: (Per the rating schedule, hypertension means that the diastolic blood
pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the
systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less
han 90mm.)
1) If the diagnosis of hypertension has not been previously established, and it is a claimed
issue, B.P. readings must be taken two or more times on each of at least three differen
days.
2) If hypertension has been previously diagnosed and is claimed, but the claimant is not on
reatment, B.P. readings must be taken two or more times on at least three different days.
3) If hypertension has been previously diagnosed, and the claimant is on treatment, take
hree blood pressure readings on the day of the examination.

23

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

11/15/16

4) If hypertension has not been claimed, take three blood pressure readings on the day of the
examination. If they are suggestive of hypertension or are borderline, readings must be
aken two or more times on at least two additional days to rule hypertension in or out.
5) In the diagnostic summary, state whether hypertension is ruled in or out after completing
hese B.P. measurements. Describe treatment for hypertension and side effects. If
hypertensive heart disease is suspected or found, follow worksheet for Heart.
14. Abdomen: Inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion. Describe any organ enlargement, ventral hernia,
mass, tenderness, etc.
15. Genital/rectal (male): Inspection and palpation of penis, testicles, epididymis, and spermatic cord. If there
is a hernia, describe type, location, size, whether complete, reducible, recurrent, supported by truss or belt,
and whether or not operable. Describe anal fissures, hemorrhoids, ulcerations, etc. Include digital exam of
rectal walls and prostate.
16. Genital/rectal (female): Pelvic exam, including inspection of introitus, vagina, and cervix, palpation of
labia, vagina, cervix, uterus, adnexa, and ovaries, rectal exam. Do Pap smear if none within past year. If
unable to conduct an examination and Pap smear, or if there is a severe or complex problem, refer to a
specialist.
17. Musculoskeletal:
a. For all joint or muscle disorders, state each muscle and joint affected.
b. Separately examine and describe in detail each affected joint. Measure active and passive range of
motion in degrees using a goniometer. In addition, provide an assessment of the effect on range of
motion and joint function of pain, weakness, fatigue, or incoordination following repetitive use or
during flare-ups. (See the appropriate musculoskeletal worksheet for more detail.) NOTE: The
diagnosis of degenerative or traumatic arthritis of any joint requires X-ray confirmation, but once
confirmed by X-ray, either in service or after service, no further X-rays of that joint are required
for disability evaluation purposes.
c. Describe swelling, effusion, tenderness, muscle spasm, joint laxity, muscle atrophy, fibrous or
bony residual of fracture. If joint is ankylosed, describe the position and angle of fixation.
d. Describe any mechanical aids used by veteran.
e. If foot problems exist, also describe objective evidence of pain at rest and on manipulation,
rigidity, spasm, circulatory disturbance, swelling, callus, loss of strength, and whether condition is
acquired or congenital.
f. If there is amputation of a part, see the appropriate worksheet.
g. With disc disease, also describe any neurological findings.
18. Endocrine: Describe signs and symptoms of any endocrine disease, effects on other body systems, and
current and past treatment. See endocrine worksheets for further guidance.
19. Neurological: Assess orientation and memory, gait, stance, and coordination, cranial nerve functions.
Assess deep tendon reflexes, pain, touch, temperature, vibration, and position, motor and sensory status of
peripheral nerves. If neurological abnormalities are found on examination, or there is a history of seizures,
refer to appropriate worksheet.
20. Psychiatric: Describe behavior, comprehension, coherence of response, emotional reaction, signs of tension
and effects on social and occupational functioning. (This is meant to be a brief screening examination. If a
mental disorder is claimed, or suspected based on the screening, an examination for diagnosis and
assessment should be conducted by a psychiatrist or psychologist.) State whether the veteran is capable of
managing his or her benefit payments in his or her own best interests without restriction. (A physical
disability which prevents the veteran from attending to financial matters in person is not a proper basis for a
finding of incompetency unless the veteran is, by reason of that disability, incapable of directing someone
else in handling the individual's financial affairs.)
D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
1. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the examination report.
2. Review all test results before providing the summary and diagnosis.
3. Follow additional worksheets, as appropriate.

Measurement of the Stump:
The stump of an amputated thigh will be measured from the perineum, at the origin of the adductor tendons, to the
bony end of the stump, with the claimant recumbent and the stump lying parallel with the other lower limb. It is to
be kept in mind that if the limb is abducted, flexed, rotated or adducted, its length will be altered. The effective
length of a thigh stump is governed by its inside dimension. Measure length of normal thigh if present and indicate
whether amputation is in upper, middle, or lower third. When amputation is bilateral, estimate the same for a person
of similar height.
The stump of an amputated leg below the knee must be measured from the insertion of the internal hamstring
muscles to the bony end of the stump with the patient recumbent and the leg flexed at 90 degrees.
The stump of an amputated arm should be measured from the anterior axillary fold to the bony end of the stump,
with the stump hanging parallel to the chest wall. Indicate whether the amputation site is above or below the
insertion of the deltoid muscle. A statement of the remaining function is the best indicator of a disability's severity.

The stump of an amputated forearm should be measured from the insertion of the biceps tendon to the bony end, with
he elbow flexed at 90 degrees. Indicate if the amputation site is above or below the attachment of the pronator teres.
Amputations of fingers should be described as through the distal, middle, or proximal phalanx or as disarticulations
hrough the distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or metacarpophalangeal joint. Resection of the head of
he metacarpal will always be reported if shown. Complete or partial loss or resection of bones of the hand will
described in terms of the fraction of each remaining. If surgery has altered the usefulness of remaining or
ransplanted digits, this will be described.
Complete or partial loss of toes or metatarsal or tarsal bones should be described as in the subparagraph above.
Always report loss of metatarsal head or other defects. Indicate if amputation is through the tarsal-metatarsal join
and if any other portions of the bones of the foot remain.

Date of Exam:

C-number:

Place of Exam:
Narrative: An examination of hearing impairment must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a
controlled speech discrimination test (specifically, the Maryland CNC recording) and a pure tone audiometry test in a sound
isolated booth that meets American National Standards Institute standards (ANSI S3.1. 1991) for ambient noise.
Measurements will be reported at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz. The examination will include the
following tests: Pure tone audiometry by air conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 8000 Hz, and by bone
conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, spondee thresholds, speech recognition using the recorded Maryland
CNC Test, tympanometry and acoustic reflex tests, and, when necessary, Stenger tests. Bone conduction thresholds are
measured when the air conduction thresholds are poorer than 15 dB HL. A modified Hughson-Westlake procedure will be
used with appropriate masking. A Stenger must be administered whenever pure tone air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000,
2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz differ by 20 dB or more between the two ears. Maximum speech recognition will be reported with
he 50 word VA approved recording of the Maryland CNC test. When speech recognition is 92% or less, a performance
intensity function will be obtained with a starting presentation level 40 dB re SRT. If necessary, the starting level will be
adjusted upward to obtain a level at least 5 dB above the threshold at 2000 Hz. The examination will be conducted withou
he use of hearing aids. Both ears must be examined for hearing impairment even if hearing loss in only one ear is at issue.
A. Review of Medical Records: Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.
B. Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
Comment on:
1. Chief complaint.
2. Situation of greatest difficulty.
3. Pertinent service history.
4. History of military, occupational, and recreational noise exposure.
5. Tinnitus - If present, state:
a. Date and circumstances of onset.
b. Whether it is unilateral or bilateral.
c. Whether it is recurrent (indicate frequency and duration).
d. The most likely etiology of the tinnitus, and specifically, if hearing loss is present, whether the tinnitus
is due to the same etiology (or causative factor) as the hearing loss.
C. Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
1. Measure puretone thresholds in decibels at the indicated frequencies (air conduction):

3. When only puretone results should be used to evaluate hearing loss, the examiner, who must be a state-licensed
audiologist, should certify that language difficulties or other problems (specify what the problems are) make the
combined use of puretone average and speech discrimination inappropriate.

D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
1. Report middle ear status, confirm type of loss, and indicate need for medical follow-up. In cases where there is
poor inter-test reliability and/or positive Stenger test results, obtain and report estimates of hearing thresholds
using a combination of behavioral testing, Stenger interference levels, and electrophysiological tests.
2. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the examination report.
E. Diagnosis:
1. Summary of audiologic test results. Indicate type and degree of hearing loss for the frequency range from 500 to
4000 Hz. For type of loss, indicate whether it is normal, conductive, sensorineural, central, or mixed. For degree,
indicate whether it is mild (26-40 HL), moderate (41-54 HL), moderately severe (55-69HL), severe (70-89 HL), or
profound (90+HL).
[For VA purposes, impaired hearing is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the
frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 dB HL or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at leas
hree of these frequencies are 26 dB HL or greater; or when speech recognition scores are less than 94%.]
2. Note whether, based on audiologic results, medical follow-up is needed for an ear or hearing problem, and

D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
Provide:
1. Pulmonary Function Tests (unless carried out within past six months and the report is either in the claims folder
or will be attached to this examination report, e.g., PFT's were in VAMC records at your facility). Spirometric
pulmonary function testing should include FVC, FEV-1, and the FEV-1/FVC ratio. Both pre- and postbronchodilatation test results should be reported. If post-bronchodilatation testing is not conducted in a
particular case, please provide an explanation of why not. A DLCO may or may not be done routinely as part of
pulmonary function testing at a particular facility. If there is a disparity between the results of different tests,
please indicate which tests are more likely to accurately reflect the severity of the condition.
DLCO note: If the DLCO was not done as a routine part of pulmonary function testing, the examiner
should use his or her judgment, based on the specific condition (e.g., whether it is obstructive, interstitial,
etc.) and other available information about the condition, as to whether a DLCO test is needed, since it is
not useful in all situations. If it may provide useful information about the severity of the condition, it should
be requested and reviewed before the examination report is submitted. If the examiner determines that the
DLCO test is not needed, a statement as to why not (e.g., there are decreased lung volumes that would no
yield valid test results) should be included in the report. Such a statement could avoid a remand from BVA
when the test is not done. However, in the case of a BVA remand in which the DLCO is requested, the
DLCO MUST be done unless there is a medical contraindication.

A. Review of Medical Records: This may be of particular importance when hepatitis C (HCV) or chronic liver
disease is claimed as related to service.
B. Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
Comment on:
1. Vomiting, hematemesis, or melena.
2. Current treatment–type (medication, diet, enzymes, etc.), duration, response, side effects.
3. Episodes of colic or other abdominal pain, fever, distention, nausea, or vomiting. Describe the duration,
frequency, severity, treatment, and response to treatment.
4. Fatigue, weakness, depression, or anxiety, and their severity.
5. Past biliary tract surgery.
6. When chronic liver disease is claimed:
• Record history of and dates for any risk factors for liver disease, including transfusion or organ
ransplant before 1992, hemodialysis, tattoo, body piercing, intravenous (or intranasal cocaine) drug
use, occupational blood exposure or other percutaneous blood exposure, high-risk sexual activity, etc.
Intramuscular gamma globulin shots may be claimed as a risk factor for hepatitis C, but, to date, no
ransmission of HCV by this means has been shown.
• Describe current symptoms of liver disease and onset of symptoms.
• Provide history of any hepatitis in service and discuss its relationship to current liver disease.
• Provide history of alcohol use/abuse, both current and past.
C. Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
Address each of the following as appropriate, and fully describe current findings:
1. Ascites.
2. Weight gain or loss, steatorrhea, malabsorption, malnutrition.
3. Hematemesis or melena (describe any episodes).
4. Pain or tenderness–location, type, precipitating factors.
5. Liver size, superficial abdominal veins.
6. Muscle strength and wasting.
7. Any other signs of liver disease, e.g., palmar erythema, spider angiomata, etc.
D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
1. For esophageal varices, X-ray, endoscopy, etc.
2. For adhesions, X-ray to show partial obstruction, delayed motility.
3. For gall bladder disease, X-ray or other objective confirmation.
4. For liver disease:
• Liver function tests (albumin, prothrombin time, bilirubin, AST, ALT, WBC, platelets).
• Serologic tests for hepatitis (HBsAg, anti-HCV (EIA or ELISA) anti-HBc, ferritin, alpha-fetoprotein);
and liver imaging (ultrasound or abdominal CT scan), as appropriate.
• If hepatitis C is the suspected diagnosis, a positive EIA (enzyme immunoassay) test for hepatitis C
should be confirmed by a RIBA (recombinant immunoblot assay) test OR by an HCV RNA test, either
qualitative or quantitative. The diagnosis of hepatitis C infection should not be made unless such tes
results are in the record and support the diagnosis. A positive EIA test alone is not sufficient to

67

Compensation and Pension Service, VBA (212)

establish the diagnosis, nor is a liver biopsy with a report that indicates it is “consistent with” hepatitis
C infection.
• With a diagnosis of hepatitis, name the specific type (A, B, C, or other), and for hepatitis B and C,
provide an opinion as to which risk factor is the most likely cause. Support the opinion by discussing
all risk factors in the individual and the rationale for your opinion. If you can not determine which risk
factor is the likely cause, state that there is no risk factor that is more likely than another to be the
cause, and explain.
• With a diagnosis of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, liver malignancy, or other chronic liver disease, state
he most likely etiology and the basis for your opinion. Address the relationship of the disease to active
service, including any hepatitis or hepatitis risk factor that occurred in service. If you cannot determine
he most likely etiology, cannot determine whether it is more likely than not that one of multiple risk
factors is the cause, or cannot determine whether it is at least as likely as not that the liver disease is
related to service, so state and explain.

severity of incident exposure (refer to trauma assessment scale scores described in Appendix B).
citations or medals received
disciplinary infractions or other adjustment problems during military

NOTE: Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires medical evidence establishing a
diagnosis of the condition that conforms to the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV, credible supporting evidence that the
claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between curren
symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. It is the responsibility of the examiner to indicate the traumatic
stressor leading to PTSD, if he or she makes the diagnosis of PTSD. Crucial in this description are specific details
of the stressor, with names, dates, and places linked to the stressor, so that the rating specialist can confirm that the
cited stressor occurred during active duty.
A diagnosis of PTSD cannot be adequately documented or ruled out without obtaining a detailed military history and
reviewing the claims folder. This means that initial review of the folder prior to examination, the history and
examination itself, and the dictation for an examination initially establishing PTSD will often require more time than
for examinations of other disorders. Ninety minutes to two hours on an initial exam is normal.

comment on validity of psychological test results
provide scores for PTSD psychometric assessments administered
state whether PTSD psychometric measures are consistent or inconsistent with a diagnosis of PTSD, based
on normative data and established "cutting scores" (cutting scores that are consistent with or supportive of a
PTSD diagnosis are as follows: PCL > 50; Mississippi Scale > 107; MMPI PTSD subscale a score > 28;
MMPI code type: 2-8 or 2-7-8)
state degree of severity of PTSD symptoms based on psychometric data (mild, moderate, or severe)
describe findings from psychological tests measuring problems other than PTSD (MMPI, etc.)

H. Diagnosis:
1. The Diagnosis must conform to DSM-IV and be supported by the findings on the examination report.
2. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible the symptoms associated with each and
a discussion of relationship.
3. Evaluation is based on the effects of the signs and symptoms on occupational and social functioning.
NOTE: VA is prohibited by statute from paying compensation for a disability that is a result of the veteran's
own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE, whether based on direct service connection, secondary service
connection, or aggravation by a service-connected condition. Therefore, when alcohol or drug abuse
accompanies or is associated with another mental disorder, separate, to the extent possible, the effects of the
alcohol or drug abuse from the effects of the other mental disorder(s). If it is not possible to separate the
effects, explain why.
I. Diagnostic Status
Axis I disorders
Axis II disorders
Axis III disorders
Axis IV (psychosocial and environmental problems)
Axis V (GAF score - current)
J. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF):
NOTE: The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may be required by BVA REMAND or
specifically requested by the rating specialist. If so, include the GAF score and note whether it refers to
current functioning. A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall GAF score, that a
separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder present when there are multiple Axis I or Axis II
diagnoses and not all are service-connected. If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation and
discussion of the rationale is needed. If it is not possible, an explanation as to why not is needed. (See the
above note pertaining to alcohol or drug abuse, the effects of which cannot be used to assess the effects of a
service-connected condition.)
DSM-IV is only for application from 11/7/96 on. Therefore, when applicable note whether the diagnosis of
PTSD was supportable under DSM-III-R prior to that date. The prior criteria under DSM-III-R are
provided as an attachment.
K. Competency: Competency, for benefits purposes, has a special meaning, and refers only to veterans’ ability to
manage benefit payments in their own best interests without restriction, and not to any other subject. State
whether the veteran is capable of managing his/her or her benefit payments in the individual's own best interests
(a physical disability which prevents the veteran from attending to financial matters in person is not a proper
basis for a finding of incompetency unless the veteran is, by reason of that disability, incapable of directing
someone else in handling the individual's financial affairs).

L. Other Opinion: Furnish any other specific opinion requested by the rating board or BVA remand (furnish the
complete rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise supporting opinion, if medical literature review was
undertaken). If the requested opinion is medically not ascertainable on exam or testing please state why. If the
requested opinion can not be expressed without resorting to speculation or making improbable assumptions say
so, and explain why. If the opinion asks " ... is it at least as likely as not ... ", fully explain the clinical findings
and rationale for the opinion.
M. Integrated Summary and Conclusions

_

Describe changes in psychosocial functional status and quality of life following trauma exposure (performance
in employment or schooling, routine responsibilities of self care, family role functioning, physical health,
social/interpersonal relationships, recreation/leisure pursuits)
Describe linkage between PTSD symptoms and aforementioned changes in impairment in functional status and
quality of life. Particularly in cases where a veteran is unemployed, specific details about the effects of PTSD
and its symptoms on employment are especially important.
If possible, describe extent to which disorders other than PTSD (e.g., substance use disorders) are independently
responsible for impairment in psychosocial adjustment and quality of life. If this is not possible, explain why
(e.g., substance use had onset after PTSD and clearly is a means of coping with PTSD symptoms).
If possible, describe pre-trauma risk factors or characteristics than may have rendered the veteran vulnerable to
developing PTSD subsequent to trauma exposure.
If possible, state prognosis for improvement of psychiatric condition and impairments in functional status.
Comment on whether veteran should be rated as competent for VA purposes in terms of being capable of
managing his/her benefit payments in his/her own best interest.

Describe changes in psychosocial functional status and quality of life since the last exam (performance in
employment or schooling, routine responsibilities of self care, family role functioning, physical health,
social/interpersonal relationships, recreation/leisure pursuits).
Describe linkage between PTSD symptoms and aforementioned changes in impairment in functional status
and quality of life. Particularly in cases where a veteran is unemployed, specific details about the effects of
PTSD and its symptoms on employment are especially important.
If possible, describe extent to which disorders other than PTSD (e.g., substance use disorders) are
independently responsible for impairment in psychosocial adjustment and quality of life. If this is no
possible, explain why (e.g., substance use had onset after PTSD and clearly is a means of coping with PTSD
symptoms).
If possible, state prognosis for improvement of psychiatric condition and impairments in functional status.
Comment on whether veteran should be rated as competent for VA purposes in terms of being capable of
managing his/her benefit payments in his/her own best interest.

NOTE: VA is prohibited by statute from paying compensation for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own
ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE, whether based on direct service connection, secondary service connection, or
aggravation by a service-connected condition. Therefore, when alcohol or drug abuse accompanies or is associated
with another mental disorder, separate, to the extent possible, the effects of the alcohol or drug abuse from the effects
of the other mental disorder(s). If it is not possible to separate the effects, explain why.
F. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF):

specifically requested by the rating specialist. If so, include the GAF score and note whether it refers to
current functioning. A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall GAF score, that a
separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder present when there are multiple Axis I or Axis II
diagnoses and not all are service-connected. If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation and
discussion of the rationale is needed. If it is not possible, an explanation as to why not is needed. (See the
above note pertaining to alcohol or drug abuse, the effects of which cannot be used to assess the effects of a

HELPFUL HINTS FROM THE SEVEN STEPS TEAM:

There may be prescriptive language that appears to make a contract detail-oriented and not
performance-based; however, agencies may have minimum requirements that must be met, such
as the specific worksheets that must be documented for the VA Medical Disability Exams. We
also see this when agencies are trying to leverage what has already been purchased that could be
a component of the proposed solution. For example, if an agency knows it must use Microsof
software because all the licenses have already been purchased, then that would be something the
agency would have to disclose when outlining the requirements. As long as the contract file
documents why minimum requirements are contained in the contract and they are based on
something that has a reasonable rationale or is mandatory, the contract can still be considered
performance based.
