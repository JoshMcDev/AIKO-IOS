VA's Statement of Objectives
VA expects to improve its current loan servicing operations through this task
order in several ways. Primary among these is to increase the number and
value of saleable loans. In addition, VA wants to be assured that all payments
for such items as taxes and insurance are always paid on time. As part of
hese activities, the VA also has an objective to improve Information
Technology data exchange, improving VA's access to information on an as
needed basis and improving VA's ability to meet customer needs and to
respond to auditors' requirements.
Complementing the effort to accomplish these three objectives, two other
equally important goals of VA are: to increase the fiduciary controls and
reports in such areas as daily reconciliations, application of cash, and
Treasury guideline requirements; and to improve default management activity
in such areas as pursuing and documenting all loss mitigation tasks and
related borrower communication efforts up to termination of a loan. This
includes taking special forbearance actions where appropriate for disabled
veterans.
Consistent with the improved activity and interface with borrowers for defaul
management, VA has an objective to improve overall customer service by
increasing responsiveness and customer contact, and minimizing customer
complaints.

As building blocks for these objectives, VA's objectives also include
increasing the efficiency of all portfolio activities, the accuracy of loan
servicing information, and the timeliness and flexibility of recurring and ad
hoc reporting. In addition, a basic building block objective is to substantially
improve loan file information, including accuracy, completeness, and
currency.
Finally, VA has an objective to have active, verifiable quality control and audi
procedures that will provide an accurate assessment of performance
objectives, their measures, and how well they are indicating the quality of
service being provided and being used to actually improve service to VA.
