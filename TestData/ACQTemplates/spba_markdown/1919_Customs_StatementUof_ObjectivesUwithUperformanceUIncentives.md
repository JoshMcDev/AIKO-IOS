## STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

## INTRODUCTION
This Statement of Objectives describes the basic objectives of the U.S. Customs
Service National Uniform Program and is provided in lieu of a Governmen
written Statement of Work (SOW). This approach provides potential offerors the
flexibility to develop cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose
innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives. It also presents the
Government with an opportunity to assess the offeror’s understanding of all
aspects of the effort to be performed by eliminating the “how to” instructions to
accomplish the required effort normally contained on the SOW the Governmen
provides to prospective offerors.

Customs Service National Uniform Program. Uniformed employees are located
