Background
VA Servicing History
When a GI home loan is foreclosed, VA usually purchases the property from the former
loan holder. The property is then marketed by VA to the general public. About 75% of
hese properties are sold with seller financing provided by VA. These types of loans,
called vendee loans, include loans made to veterans, non-veterans, owner occupants, and
investors. Some delinquent GI loans are acquired from lenders by VA prior to
foreclosure – these are called refunded loans. Additionally, Native American Direc
Loans (NADL) are held by VA, as are older, previously sold vendee loans that were
repurchased under 38 CFR 36.4600; a small number of direct loans funded by VA under
he Special Adapted Housing program; and older direct loans funded by VA under the GI
Direct Home Loan program prior to nationwide availability of private lender funds. As a
group, these loans constitute VA’s loan portfolio. The loans were originated or acquired
at 46 VA Regional Offices (ROs). The borrowers made payments directly to VA as the
loan holder.
Until 1997, servicing of the portfolio of loans was the responsibility of the Loan
Guaranty Division at each of the Regional Offices. VA provided full mortgage servicing,
including customer service functions, tax payments, and insurance premium payments,
for the portfolio of approximately 29,000 loans. Generally, accounting was a centralized
function with monthly payment notices directing payments to a central lock-box.
VA’s portfolio had declined over previous years because direct loans were seldom made
o veterans under the GI Direct Home Loan program. In addition, most of the vendee
loans are sold on a servicing released basis within six months of origination. Because of
he reduction in VA’s active portfolio being serviced through the 46 Regional Offices, i
was determined the loans could be subserviced by a single private contractor at less cos
o the Government.
Effective January 31, 1997, VA contracted with a commercial company for most of its
portfolio loan servicing activities. The contract was for one year with four option years.
The contract also requires that the servicer maintain records reflecting the status of all
real estate owned (REOs) by VA. (These records have sometimes been referred to within
VA as “non-loans”.) The servicer is responsible for paying all real estate taxes, ground
rents, and other recurring charges for REOs, in addition to providing flood zone
determinations for each property. Under the current contract, approximately 29,000 loans
and 15,000 REOs are being serviced.
VA retains certain functions, such as custody of loan instruments, approval and
completion of loan terminations, and preparation and execution of required loan
documents (e.g., mortgage satisfactions or assignments, as well as warranty deeds for
paid-in-full installment contract loans). The VA Portfolio Loan Oversight Unit (PLOU)
was established at the Indianapolis, Indiana Regional Office to act as liaison with the
contractor and to review loans referred to VA for termination.

Current VA Portfolio Origination/Acquisition Process
This section describes VA’s portfolio loan program procedures and presents process
maps and narrative descriptions of the maps. The process maps are based on interviews
with staff at VA Regional Offices (ROs), Regional Loan Centers (RLCs), Regional
Counsel (RC), VA’s Portfolio Loan Oversight Unit (PLOU), and the current Servicer.
The diagram below outlines VA’s process for originating and acquiring various types of
loans. Following the diagram is a brief description of each of the types of loans.

(Loan Type 1) Direct Loans - Typically created when VA issues loans directly to
veterans on Native American Trust Land under the NADL Program. This loan type also
includes a small number of direct loans funded by VA under the Special Adapted
Housing program, and a declining number of older direct loans funded by VA under the
GI Direct Home Loan program prior to the nationwide availability of private lender
funding.
(Loan Types 3, 4, & 7) Vendee Loans - Created when VA directly funds a loan to
finance the sale of an acquired property (REO).
(Loan Type 4) 4600 Repurchased Loans - Created when VA repurchases a vendee
loan previously sold to a private lender under the terms of 38 CFR 4600. (Vendee loans
are no longer sold under the terms of this regulation.)
September 8, 2000

Enclosure 2- 4

(Loan Types 5 & 8) Refunded Loans - Created when VA purchases a guaranteed loan
from a private lender to help a veteran avoid foreclosure and the loss of his/her home.
VA’s portfolio consists of loans secured by properties located in the continental United
States, District of Columbia, Hawaiian Islands, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (San
Juan), and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Guam).
Overview of the Current Servicing Process
As shown in the following diagram of the VA processes, RLCs service delinquent GI
loans, a primary input to the portfolio process. RLCs also perform the tasks to acquire
refunded and repurchased loans, and originate direct loans. ROs sell acquired properties
hrough the Property Management (PM) activities, thus originating vendee loans. Once
loans are in the portfolio and properties are added to the PM inventory, the Servicer
services individual loans and pays taxes on properties in the REO inventory. The
Servicer services delinquent portfolio loans and refers them to PLOU for foreclosure
approval and processing. PLOU services loans during foreclosure and RC forecloses
portfolio loans. The PLOU and VA Central Office manage the overall portfolio.

The current Servicer has the responsibility of boarding new loans, collecting payments
from borrowers, providing customer service, servicing delinquent loans, paying taxes,
and paying insurance premiums and claims. One of the key aspects of the servicing
September 8, 2000

Enclosure 2- 5

responsibilities is to establish and maintain REO records and pay taxes for REOs that
originate from foreclosed and acquired properties, redeemed loans, and cash sale
withdrawals. Another current key aspect of servicing VA's portfolio is partnering with
PLOU to initiate the foreclosure process. All loans subject to foreclosure proceedings are
referred to PLOU for approval and ongoing servicing of those loans once referred.

GSA FAS Contractor Guidelines
This VA effort will result in the award of a task order under GSA’s Federal Supply
Schedule (FSS) program for Financial Asset Services (FAS). It will provide loan
servicing for approximately 29,000 loans and 15,000 REOs. As a result, all the terms and
conditions of the offerors' current GSA contracts will apply, including all references to
federal, state, and local laws and guidelines. It will be the offeror's responsibility to
ensure it understands all of these requirements. In addition, it is the offeror’s
responsibility to know and comply with all current laws or regulations pertaining to this
requirement (e.g., Treasury regulations, IRS reporting requirements, etc.).
In addition to all guidelines, procedures or circumstances that are addressed in the GSA
FAS or current laws or regulations pertaining to this requirement, the servicer will, at a
minimum, meet FNMA guidelines. If there are no laws, regulations, or guidelines, the
servicer will follow generally accepted servicing customs and practices within the
mortgage servicing industry. For unusual actions that are clearly not covered by any of
he above, the servicer will consult with the Task Order Project Manager (TOPM).

Enclosure 2- 6

Statement of Objectives
Vision
The purpose of this task order is to obtain loan servicing in support of VA's portfolio tha
will significantly improve loan guaranty operations and service to its customers. This
effort is envisioned to provide VA with repeatable, defined, accurate, timely, and well
managed processes that produce quality service and products that are affordable. This
service will be implemented and sustained across all VA's operational elements.

Scope
The purpose of this delivery order is to provide the full range of loan servicing support.
This includes such activities as customer management, paying taxes and insurance,
default management, accounting, foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc., as well as future actions
associated with loan servicing. This Statement of Objectives reflects current VA policies
and practices, allowing offerors to propose and price a solution to known requirements.
It is anticipated that specific loan servicing requirements and resulting objectives will
change over the life of this order. This will result in VA modifying this order to
incorporate in-scope changes.

VA's Objectives
VA expects to improve its current loan servicing operations through this task order in
several ways. Primary among these is to increase the number and value of saleable loans.
In addition, VA wants to be assured that all payments for such items as taxes and
insurance are always paid on time. As part of these activities, the VA also has an
objective to improve Information Technology data exchange, improving VA's access to
information on an as needed basis and improving VA's ability to meet customer needs
and to respond to auditors' requirements.
Complementing the effort to accomplish these three objectives, two other equally
important goals of VA are: to increase the fiduciary controls and reports in such areas as
daily reconciliations, application of cash, and Treasury guideline requirements; and to
improve default management activity in such areas as pursuing and documenting all loss
mitigation tasks and related borrower communication efforts up to termination of a loan.
This includes taking special forbearance actions where appropriate for disabled veterans.
Consistent with the improved activity and interface with borrowers for defaul
management, VA has an objective to improve overall customer service by increasing
responsiveness and customer contact, and minimizing customer complaints.

September 8, 2000

Enclosure 2- 7

As building blocks for these objectives, VA's objectives also include increasing the
efficiency of all portfolio activities, the accuracy of loan servicing information, and the
imeliness and flexibility of recurring and ad hoc reporting. In addition, a basic building
block objective is to substantially improve loan file information, including accuracy,
completeness, and currency.
Finally, VA has an objective to have active, verifiable quality control and audi
procedures that will provide an accurate assessment of performance objectives, their
measures, and how well they are indicating the quality of service being provided and
being used to actually improve service to VA.
The following section's discussion provides additional information about the specific
activities that support VA's loan servicing objectives and management activities
