HCaTS Contractors & Their Socio-Economic Status
The list of HCaTS contract holders and their socio-economic status under each vehicle and pool is
available on:
- GSA eLibrary (gsaelibrary.gsa.gov): Search for “HCaTS”.
- HCaTS Website (gsa.gov/hcats): under “Buyers Guidance and Resources”.

Contract Pricing

Pricing is primarily based on competition at the task order level. The HCaTS PMO provides ceiling
fully loaded labor rates only for Sole-Source T&M or L-H Task Orders.

Labor Categories

For the list of HCaTS Labor Categories, see Attachment J.1 of the HCaTS contracts on the HCaTS
website. The labor categories are not mandatory and labor categories can be added at the
discretion of the Ordering Contracting Officer. The qualification requirements for each labor
category’s level of expertise (Jr. Jour. Sr. SME) is explained under HCaTS contracts Section B.2.1.

Ancillary Support
Specialized and SCA labor and Other Direct Costs (Material, Equipment, etc.) can be added;
however, ancillary support cannot be the preponderance of the work. All required clauses must be
added as necessary (e.g. Wage Determination, SCA clauses).

Developing IGCE/ Price Fair & Reasonableness Determination
For acquisition planning purposes and developing the IGCE in addition to other market research
ools, the HCaTS PMO recommends using the following:
• Discovery Tool (https://discovery.gsa.gov/): information on all HCaTS contract holders and
streamlines the process for developing acquisition planning.
• Contract Awarded Labor Categories (CALC) Tool (https://calc.gsa.gov/): helps find awarded
prices to use in negotiations for labor contracts. It offers ceiling prices, fully burdened
costs, services data, and worldwide rates.
• OASIS Price Estimating Tool (PET) (https://oasispet.gsa.gov/): assists in the development of
he labor portion of the IGCE. Its power lies in the ability to index pricing to approximately
640 precise geographic locations.

Contract Access Fee (CAF)
The CAF for HCaTS is 0.75% of the TOTAL task order value and it must be a separate and distinc
CLIN. Cost-Type CLIN for CAF is preferable. There must be one CAF CLIN for each period of the
contract.

Max and Min Order
The minimum order under HCaTS is at the Micro-Purchase Threshold and the maximum,
cumulative dollar amount for HCaTS, including all task order and all options, if exercised, is $3.45
billion for Pool 1 and $2.3 billion for Pool 2.
