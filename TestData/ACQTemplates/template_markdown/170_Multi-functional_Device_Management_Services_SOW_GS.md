Statement of Work –Multifunction Device (MFD) Management Services

I. BACKGROUND
The Department of XXXXX leases and purchases multifunctional devices (MFD) and associated
lifecycle maintenance services to support the Agency Headquarters, annexes, and field offices
across the continental U.S. Agency XXXXX currently has approximately MFDs of various makes
and models, some of which are owned by the Government and some of which are leased.
Agency XXXX manages approximately XXXXX MFDs that handle the needs of 80% of all the
Agency XXXX bureaus and offices within the continental U.S. Currently, 90% of the Agencymanaged devices are located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area (defined for purposes of
his task order as the area within a 50-mile radius from the geographical center of Washington
DC), with the remaining 10% of devices located in the field offices throughout the U.S.
Copy volumes for each MFD vary from 1,500 copies per month to more than 20,000 copies per
month, currently using equipment manufactured by Canon, Oce, and Xerox. The age of these
MFDs range from three months to five years (typical scheduled useful life), with approximately
10% reaching seven years of service before needing (typical end of lifecycle) replacement.

II. SCOPE
The contractor shall provide MFDs under operating leases with comprehensive lifecycle
supplies, service, and maintenance, in support of the agency Print Management program.
The Government will manage currently owned and leased devices until the end of their lease or
duty cycle, at which time the contractor will provide replacements for those devices, as directed
by the Government in writing, at which time the government will specify the MFD volume band
required, the device location, and other pertinent details of the new device.
High speed production “digital presses” used in dedicated production facilities are not included
in this requirement.

III. GOVERNING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The contractor shall provide services in accordance with its General Services Administration
(GSA) Office Imaging and Document Solutions under Federal Supply Schedule 36.

IV. REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the contractor's schedule contract, monthly base fee pricing shall represen
otal cost of ownership, including device price, service and consumables, and a calculation of
he cost to operate the device. The devices shall be packaged with consumables (excluding
paper) and maintenance agreements/extended warranties. Periodic preventive maintenance of
machines leased and purchased under this task order and key operator training are also
required.
In addition, the contractor shall deliver a method of managing comprehensive device
information, including meter reads, billing, serial numbers, up-time calculations, and leasing
history and replacement cycles of the devices. The method must be deployed using the Interne

to the Agency for operation by Agency personnel. The method must take into account the fact
hat most or all of the devices deployed will not be connected to an external network.
The terms of the schedule contract establish maintenance and consumable pricing contingen
on established volume bands. The following are the volume bands with minimum device speeds
for multifunction devices (MFD) and network printers (NP). (Color Network Printers are no
awarded in volume band five.)
