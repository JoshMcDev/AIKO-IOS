Exhibit B: Quality Control Plan Sample

Prior to beginning work, each employee will be trained to perform the task he or she has been
hired to perform . This training will consist of a review and thorough explanation of the
contract specifications and requirements, followed by ‘on - the job ' training to ensure that the
contract requirements are understood . All members of a crew will be cross-trained, so tha
hey understand all aspects of a particular type of work . Following training, each employee
will be provided w ith a checklist of work that they are required to perform, which will serve to
ensure that all aspects of a particular job are completed on time. The employee will mark each
item as it is completed ( with completion time ), and will sign and date each sheet to ensure
accountability for completed work .

-

Prior to start of the contract, the Contractor will designate a Quality Control Inspector (QCI) in
writing. The designated QCI will perform inspections of completed work as soon as possible
o ensure that the work meets contract specifications. The inspection schedule will depend on
he type of work being completed ; items of a routine nature will be inspected based on a
random or planned sampling schedule. 100% of unusual items, items which are more
important, or highly visible items will be inspected .
Allowable reject levels for all items of work will be zero.
If a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) is issued by the government, the Contractor will
review' the CDR with the QCI within one day of receipt of the CDR , and will meet with the
Corps of Engineers representative as soon as possible. Prior to meeting with the Corps
representative, the Contractor will meet with the QCI and the individual /crew responsible for
completing the work to determine the cause of the contract discrepancy and what actions will
be required to prevent any reoccurrence. The Contractor will document these actions on the
CDR for submittal to the government.

The contractor w ill modify these procedures as required to ensure that contract specifications are
met.

within those job families . In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and / or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
( See 29 CFR 4.6 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( v ) ) When multiple wage determinations are
and this contrac
included in a contract a separate SF - 1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class ( es ) is to be conformed

.

.

.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows :

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation ( s ) and computes a proposed rate ( s )

.

2 ) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title ( s ) a Federal grade equivalency ( FGE ) for each
proposed classification ( s ) job description ( s ) and rationale for proposed wage
rate ( s ) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class ( es ) of employees
performs any contract work

.

.

3 ) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency ' s recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U . S .
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review ( See 29 CFR 4.6 ( b ) ( 2 ) (ii) ) .

4 ) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he reques

.

5 ) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division ' s decision to the
contractor

.

6 ) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination ( See
29 CFR 4.6 ( b ) ( 2 ) (iii) )

.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF - 1444 or bond paper

When preparing a conformance request the " " Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations " " should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination ( See 29 CFR 4.152 ( c ) (1) ) . "

Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $ 27.63 ( or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $ 455 per

within those job families . In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

$ 27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees

example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
