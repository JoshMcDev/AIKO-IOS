Basis of Award:
Subject to the provisions contained herein, the government will make an ALL or NONE award to the responsible

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR part 25. For
line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end
products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only

14

offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no
offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is
expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief,
hat the offeror and/or any of its principals–
(1) □ Are, □ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the
award of contracts by any Federal agency;

(2) □ Have, □ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment
rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain,
or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrus
statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or
destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen
property;
(3) □ Are, □ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity
with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) □ Have, □ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal
axes in an amount that exceeds the threshold at 9.104-5(a)(2) for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability
is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the
liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay
he tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection
action is precluded.
(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which
entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
axpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer
has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals
contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the
course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no
prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the
axpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal
rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is
making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the
axpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

15

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced
collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The
Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included

EVALUATION FACTORS
It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the government to make award to the contractor whose quote
is the Best Value - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The evaluation factors that establish the
requirements of acceptability are set forth in this RFQ. Quote evaluation procedures will take place in three phases.
Phase 1- Administrative Compliance: Phase 1 will evaluate the submission and completion of required documents
(Evaluation Factor 1). Failure to provide all required documents, fully completed, when submitting a quote will
result in the quote being removed from evaluation and eligibility for award. If a quote is found to contain all
necessary documents, fully completed, that are required by this RFQ, it will continue to Phase 2 of the quote
evaluation procedures.

Phase 2- Technical Acceptability: Phase 2 of the quote evaluation procedures will assess the quote based upon
Evaluation Factors 2 through 7, to ensure that the quote is technically acceptable. At any point in Phase 2 of the
quote evaluation procedures, if it is determined that the quote is not technically acceptable, no further criteria will
be evaluated, and the quote will no longer be considered for award.

Phase 3- Price: Under Phase 3 of the quote evaluation procedures, the contracting officer will evaluate prices as ‘All
or None’ responses, and best value will be determined using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation
procedures. Pursuant to FAR 8.404(d), prices under MAS contracts are already determined fair and reasonable.
However, the Government will perform additional analysis to ensure best value, as well as seek further reductions
from the contractor's negotiated schedule as outlined FAR 8.405-4. Quotes found not Technically Acceptable during
Phases 1 and 2 will not be evaluated in Phase 3.

In cases of identical pricing, the socio-economic status of a business will be taken into consideration IAW FAR 8.4055(d).

REQUIREMENTS OF TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY: EVALUATION FACTORS

Phase 1: Administrative Compliance
Evaluation Factor 1: Submission AND Completion of Required Documents
All quotes must be submitted through eBuy upon the close date of the RFQ to be considered for award. In
circumstances of eBuy technical issues, quotes or portions of quotes will be accepted via email upon prior
authorization by the Contracting Officer.

The following documents must be submitted complete in response to the RFQ to be considered for award:
1. Signed and completed Vendor Response Document (VRD) Yes______ No______.
2. Signed MIL-STD-129 Compliance Form Yes______ No______.

Yes______ No______.
*Reps and certs in System for Award Management (SAM.gov) should be completed prior
o RFQ closing. If self-certification has not been completed at 52.212-3(v) Covered Telecommunications
Equipment or Services-Representation. Section 889(a)(1)(A) and section 889 (a)(1)(B) of Public Law
115-232, vendors shall submit self-certification under provision 52.204-24 with their quote submission.

23

Phase 2: Technical Acceptability
Evaluation Factor 2: Schedule Quotes
A contractor must certify that the part numbers quoted are currently covered under the contractor's MAS contrac
upon the close date of the RFQ. This certification must be completed by signing and submitting the attached Vendor
Response Document (VRD). Open-market quotes will not be considered for award. If an item is not viewable on GSA
Advantage, on the date of the RFQ closing, the Vendor must provide evidence that the item is on schedule.

Evaluation Factor 3: Shipment/Delivery
FOB Terms should be quoted as FOB Destination only. Quoted lead times should be at or better than the MAS
contract of the contractor submitting a quote if at all possible. Please quote the most realistic lead time for delivery
of the items being quoted. Adherence to MIL-STD-129R is required for this procurement. Vendors will be required to
self-certify that they can and will meet these standards as part of the solicitation package. Appliances requested are
not required to be palletized, per customer instructions.
Evaluation Factor 4: Trade Agreement Ac
As described in FAR Subpart 25.4, the Trade Agreements Act (TAA) applies to all Schedule contracts and sales. I
states that only U.S-made or designated-country end supplies (products) can be offered or sold under Schedule
contracts. Designated countries are determined by multilateral and bilateral trade agreements the United States
maintains internationally. Products provided as a result of this RFQ must be in compliance with the Trade
Agreements Act. The VRD document requires confirmation of the country of origin.
Evaluation Factor 5: Salient Characteristics
Through submission of a quote, contractors are certifying that their quoted product(s) meet the salien
characteristics of the item requested. If quoting other than the name brand and part number(s) specified in the RFQ,
echnical documents must be submitted for the equivalent items quoted. The technical documents will be reviewed
o make an acceptability determination for the ‘or equal’ item.
Evaluation Factor 6: Past Performance
The Government will evaluate recent and relevant past performance information no older than 3 years to assess the
overall risk associated with a particular Vendor as well as the confidence the Government has in the Vendor’s ability
o successfully perform requirements. To be considered acceptable for Factor 6:
1. Recent and relevant Past Performance information retrieved from the Contractor Performance Assessmen
Reporting System (CPARS) shall reflect a minimum of ‘Satisfactory’ or better final overall ratings in any of the
following categories: Quality, Timeliness of Delivery, Customer Satisfaction, Cost, and Safety/Security.
2. The Vendor shall have no negative reported data or active exclusions as confirmed by the Federal Awardee
Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS).

3. The contractor shall have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) with no active
exclusions.

SAM will be checked for all Vendors who reply to the RFQ in accordance with FAR 9.405(a), as well as those whose
quote is found to be technically acceptable for Evaluation Factors 1-5.

24

The Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance. Primary sources
may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Contractor Performance
Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using CAGE / DUNS number identified in the Vendor’s quote, Federal
Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and any other known sources not provided by the
Vendor.
Unavailability of Past Performance Information: IAW FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), in the case of a Vendor without a record
of recent and relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available; the Offeror
may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Evaluation Factor 7: Electronic Data Interchange OR Vendor Portal Requirements
Vendors will be required to be Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) capable or have the ability to receive Purchase
Orders through the OMS Vendor Portal in order to receive an award as a result of this solicitation. GSA no longer has
a fax platform, as of the end of calendar year 2018. Enrollment in either program is required upon award and mus
be requested no later than five days after receipt of award. Failure to enroll may cause your award to be cancelled
or terminated.

Phase 3: Price
Evaluation Factor 8: Schedule Pricing Compliance
In consideration for the opportunity afforded a successful contractor, in accordance with FAR 8.405-4, Heartland
Acquisition Center requests contractors to further reduce their negotiated Schedule Contract prices for this
requirement. The prices to the Government shall be as low, or lower than, the prices negotiated on the contractor's
MAS contract. Heartland Acquisition Center will not award to a contractor whose quoted price, in response to this
RFQ, exceeds the contractor’s current MAS pricing, including freight. Please note that the Government reserves the
right to enter discussions and/or seek additional discounts.

Evaluation Factor 9: Quoted Price
In order to qualify for an ‘All or None’ award the Vendor must submit price and delivery information for the full
quantity of all items solicited. The Government will not issue multiple orders totaling the requested quantities as the
acquisition is a onetime buy. Award will be made to the Vendor whose quote is determined compliant as an ‘ALL or
NONE’ response, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable, and the best value to the Government. Pursuant to FAR
8.404(d), prices under MAS contracts are already determined fair and reasonable. However, the Government will
perform additional analysis to ensure best value and is seeking further reductions from the contractor's negotiated
schedule as outlined in FAR 8.405-4.
The low aggregate offeror will be determined by multiplying the unit price (inclusive of freight as applicable)
submitted on each item by the quantity specified and adding the resultant extensions. In order to qualify for an
award, price and delivery must be submitted on all items. The Government will award one purchase order, per par
number, to a single Vendor as determined to be in the best interests of the Government.

In cases of identical pricing, the socio-economic status of a business will be taken into consideration IAW FAR 8.4055(d).
