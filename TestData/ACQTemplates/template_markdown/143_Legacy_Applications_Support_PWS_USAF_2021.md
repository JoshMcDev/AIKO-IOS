## LEGACY APPLICATIONS SUPPORT
April 2021
1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES. The contractor shall provide all labor, supplies, materials
and services to provide application development support, system operational support, and
customer support for the 78 ABW/SCP, Robins AFB, GA. Legacy Applications include
Facilities and Equipment Maintenance System (FEM), Enterprise Management Information
System (EMIS), WR-Depot Maintenance & Accounting & Production System (DMAPS)
Reporting Environment, Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and Cognos Business
Intelligence Reports Development (WR-DDSRI/DRIDB).
1.1. Legacy Systems DESCRIPTIONS
1.1.1. Facilities and Equipment Maintenance System (FEM). The D130 FEM system
provides an automated tracking and control system for managing facilities and
equipment maintenance, project planning, equipment calibration, equipmen
maintenance contracts, inventory control, equipment purchases and costs, material and
labor, equipment dispatches and tool management throughout enterprise Air Force.
There are approximately 5000 user accounts for FEM across the enterprise.
1.1.2. Enterprise Management Information System (EMIS). Enterprise Managemen
Information System (EMIS). EMIS is a suite of applications designed for expediting
and enhancing depot maintenance information. EMIS consolidates data from
numerous databases into one website for reporting, analyzing and updating. EMIS
database receives input from the Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS),
Inventory Tracking System (ITS), Automated Labor Standard Data System (ALSDS),
Exchangeables Productions System (EPS), Programmed Depot Maintenance
Scheduling System (PDMSS), and Center of Parts Activity (COPA). The EMIS suite
consists of the Role Oriented Consolidated Information Tool (ROCIT), Job
Sequencing Tool (JST), Maintenance Work Requests (MWR), Facilitate Other
Maintenance (FOM), electronic Work Control Document (eWCD), Change Control
Manager (CCM), Manufacturing Planning Control System (MPCS), Routed Item Parts
Locator (RIPL), and Resource Cost Center (XX-RCC). EMIS augments Programmed
Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS) report capability and user research.
PDMSS is the USAF standard project management information system, which
facilitates planning, tracking, scheduling and execution, and performance measuremen
activities for programmed /unprogrammed depot maintenance workload. The
requirements supported by PDMSS include facilitating workflow scheduling by
operation and major job; optimizing resource allocations; managing capacity and labor
utilization more effectively; facilitating competitive positioning; and strengthening
performance measurement visibility. There are approximately 5000 user accounts for
EMIS.

1.1.3. Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS). DMAPS is a
suite of systems provided as a Department of Defense standard cost accounting system for
Depot Maintenance. DMAPS management information systems impact the strategic
objectives, core processes and operations of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and the
Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). The DMAPS suite consist of a number of
applications that support maintenance operations for production labor, materials and
financials. The material systems, the Automated Bill of Material (ABOM) and NAVAIR
Material Management System (NIMMS) support all depot maintenance material operations;
he financial systems, the Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS),
provides as system of record for cost of labor, material and other maintenance costs; provides
chief financial officer compliance (CFO) and a standard financial management system in
which budget, performance, and accounting data are integrated; the Cost Performance and
Budget Module (CPBM) delivers actual/budgeted financial and production information and
performance indicators; the Integration Engine (IE) facilitates information between the
legacy systems; Depot Cost and Scheduling Tool (DCAST) tracks costs, material
ransactions, and production labor. There are approximately 8700 user accounts for DMAPS.
