PREVENTING PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS AND PERFORMANCE OF INHERENTLY GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS (JUN 2018)

A personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor’s personnel. This
contract action is for non-personal services and is not a personal services contract action. Due to the need for close interaction of government and contractor
personnel, it is essential for all contractor personnel for this contract performing at Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) designated worksites to receive
supervision from their parent company and avoid employer-employee relationships with government officials. In addition, it is important for contractor
personnel to recognize and avoid circumstances that may appear to be personal services. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 37.104 provides
important information to be aware of to avoid performing these types of duties. The contractor awarded this contract shall ensure their employees and
subcontractors comply with this requirement and receive supervision from their parent company to avoid performance of a personal services contract.

(b) “Inherently governmental function” means, as a matter of policy, a function so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by
Government employees. An inherently governmental function includes activities requiring either the exercise of discretion in applying Government authority,
or the making of value judgments in making decisions for the Government. Governmental functions normally fall into two categories: the act of governing, i.e.,
he discretionary exercise of Government authority, and monetary transactions and entitlements. It is essential for all contractor personnel performing services
at DEA designated worksites to recognize and understand what inherently government functions are. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 7.5 Inherently Governmental Functions and the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 11-01,
Performance of Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions, provide important information regarding inherently governmental functions to be aware of to
avoid performing these types of duties. The contractor awarded this contract shall ensure their employees and subcontractors comply with this requirement.
(c)

Contractors providing personnel who perform services on-site at DEA offices must certify via the “Contractor Employee Certification Concerning Prohibition of
Personal Services Contracts and Inherently Governmental Functions” form that its on-site employee(s) have read and understand FAR 37.104, Personal services
contracts, and FAR subpart 7.5 before they may begin work at an on-site DEA office. The Contractor on-site supervisor shall address any questions or concerns
with the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) or Contracting Officer.

KEY PERSONNEL (JAN 2014)

(a)

Key Personnel are individuals that are considered essential to the successful performance of this contract. Prior to diversion of any of the specified individuals
o other programs, a significant increase or reduction in the level of effort, or other substitution of any other personnel for the individuals designated as Key
Personnel by the Prime Contractor (or any subcontractor or member of any teaming agreement or similar arrangement), the Prime Contractor shall notify the
Contracting Officer reasonably in advance and shall submit justification, including proposed substitutions, in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impac
on the contract effort. There shall be no diversion, substitution, or significant increase or reduction to the level of effort of key personnel without the prior
written approval of the Contracting Officer. The contract will be modified to reflect the addition or deletion of key personnel.

(b)

The following individual(s) is/are hereby designated as Key Personnel in the performance of this contract:

Name

Position

Level of Effort

(c)

Because these key positions significantly affect contract risk and performance, the Prime Contractor shall take all reasonable and necessary measures to
mitigate any impact on contract performance and minimize the period that these positions are vacant. When a key personnel position is vacated for any
reason, the Prime Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) in writing and provide a risk mitigation and replacement strategy for the
position. The Prime Contractor shall provide weekly status reports to the COR on efforts to fill the position until replacement key personnel report under the
contract.

(d)

All replacement candidates for a Key Personnel position shall have academic training, licenses, experience, practical skills, knowledge, and expertise equivalent
o or better than the individual they are being nominated to replace. For each individual to be nominated as a replacement of a Key Personnel, the Prime
Contractor shall submit to the COR a résumé or other appropriate statement of qualifications.

(e)

The Government reserves the right to approve all proposed substitutions and may disapprove a candidate when the candidate’s qualifications are significantly
less than the qualifications of a Key Personnel being replaced. However, if the Government agrees to accept an individual as a replacement Key Personnel
whose qualifications are significantly less than the qualifications of the individual being replaced, the labor rate applicable to that Key Personnel position may be
subject to downward adjustment or renegotiated.

(f)

Approved candidates cannot begin performance under the contract until all required background checks have been completed and appropriate security
clearances have been granted. Failure by the Prime Contractor to fill a Key Personnel vacancy (whether via its own employee or that of a subcontractor) may be
considered to be a material performance issue that will reflect on the Prime Contractor in any performance evaluation.

(g)

The Government reserves the right to re-characterize a position by removing the “Key Personnel” designation and all work performed thereafter is no longer
subject to the terms of this clause.

(h)

Additional Key Personnel positions, if required after award, will be added by bilateral modification to the contract.

DEA-2852.204-83 (October 2015)
PUBLIC TRUST POSITIONS—DEA CONTRACTOR SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED (SBU) INFORMATION/U.S. CITIZENSHIP REQUIRED
DEA contractor companies, consultants or subcontractor companies (collectively referred to as “Contractors”)
performing under a DEA contract, task order, purchase order, delivery order, blanket purchase agreemen
(“BPA”), reimbursable agreement (“RA”), and/or other types of contractual agreements (all referred to herein as
“Contracts”) may access DEA information, Information Technology (IT) systems, DEA facilities and/or space, in
compliance with DEA Contractor Security Requirements (DEA-2852.204-83) and the On-Site Contractor
Responsibilities document (attached hereto as Exhibit 2
).
I. GENERAL
DEA’s Office of Security Programs/Personnel Security Section (“ISR”) will request that the Office of Personnel
Management (“OPM”) conduct background investigations on all Contractor personnel assigned to this contrac
and on those officers of the Contractor (including the Security Officer and Alternate Security Officer) who will be
directly involved in any aspect of management of the assigned personnel. The type of background investigation
will be determined by DEA’s ISR, which reserves the right to determine the type of investigation required for all
Contractor positions. At a minimum, DEA will conduct criminal and consumer reporting background
investigations in accordance with federal law and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) policies.
Only United States citizens, by birth or naturalized, shall be permitted to perform services for DEA under this
contract. All personnel assigned to this contract must be approved in writing by ISR for access to SBU
information prior to working on any DEA contract.
A clearance for access to National Security Information (NSI) is not required, nor authorized by this contract.
However, a previously conducted and current background investigation that was favorably adjudicated may be
accepted and supplemented with criminal record and credit report checks conducted by DEA. See Section IV(D)
below.
All applicants must have resided legally in the United States for at least three (3) years of the last five (5) years.
The three (3) years should be consecutive, unless the applicant was:





a U.S. Government employee assigned to a U.S. embassy or U.S. consulate in a foreign country;
a U.S. Government Contractor’s employee, who is a U.S. citizen assigned to a U.S. embassy, U.S.
consulate, or U.S. military installation in a foreign country and who is not ordinarily a resident of tha
country;
a member of the U.S. armed forces stationed in a foreign country; or
a dependent family member of a U.S. Government or U.S. armed forces employee assigned overseas.

II. CONTRACTOR’S POINT OF CONTACT
DEA’s designated Contracting Officer’s Representative (“COR”) or the Task Monitor (“TM”) shall be the
Contractor’s point of contact for all personnel security communications, inquiries, and issues regarding this
contract. All required documents must be submitted by the Contractor to the COR/TM. The COR/TM will
communicate with the Contractor on all personnel suitability issues. The COR/TM will communicate with an
applicant on a personnel suitability issue only when communicating through the Contractor would violate the
applicant’s rights under the Freedom Of Information Act (“FOIA”)/Privacy Act (“PA”). ISR may communicate
directly with the Contractor, its employees, or its applicants ONLY for the purpose of providing assistance with

Page 1 of 10

DEA-2852.204-83 (October 2015)
he Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). The Contractor shall immediately inform the
COR/TM in writing, when an employee has: (1) transferred to another contract; (2) resigned; or (3) been
erminated by the Contractor for any type of action that constitutes a termination in the Contractor-Employee
relationship. The COR/TM will provide this information to ISR.
III. CONTRACTOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES
A. GENERAL:

The Contractor shall ensure that all applicant packages submitted to DEA meet the basic eligibility
requirements for job skills, required certificates, residency and that the applicant packages have been
reviewed against the disqualifying factors in Section V below and any disqualifying information in
he applicant’s background has been favorably mitigated. The Contractor shall make every effort to
preclude incurrence of avoidable costs to the Government by ensuring that all applicants and
personnel proposed on this contract are eligible, reliable, and of reputable background and sound
character. The Contractor’s time and expenses for recruiting, interviewing and security screening
are either considered overhead (“OH”) or General and Administrative (G&A) expenses and may no
be billed directly to DEA.
Contractors shall include the following statement in employment advertisements: “Applicants selected will be
subject to a Government background investigation and must meet eligibility and suitability requirements.”

The Contractor shall verify the applicant’s current home address, telephone number(s), prior work experience
and answer delinquent debt-related issues that may potentially disqualify an applicant from consideration for
employment on a DEA contract.
In accordance with DEA Clause 2852.204-78, the Contractor shall submit prescribed information on
employees supporting DEA contracts in the Contractor Personnel Reporting Requirement (“CPRR”)
Template located on the Special Contractor Reporting Requirements page of www.DEA.gov.
The Contractor shall ensure that all public trust related forms and questionnaires are filled out correctly and
completely. The Contractor shall respond to the COR/TM’s request for additional information or documents
regarding the background investigation within fourteen (14) calendar days, unless the COR/TM provides a
written extension. Failure to submit the requested information or documents within fourteen (14) calendar
days will cause the entire package to be rejected and it will be returned to the Contractor without any further
action.
Applicants whose background investigations result in a determination of unsuitable or are otherwise
determined unfavorable based on derogatory information shall be removed from further consideration for
performance on this or any DEA contract. DEA reserves the right to refuse the services of and/or terminate
any Contractor employee or applicant who is or may be judged an unacceptable risk. The COR/TM will
inform the Contractor in writing of any objections concerning specific applicants and personnel, but is no
permitted to provide specific information due to the FOIA/PA.
A determination by DEA that a person is not suitable to perform work under this contract is not a denial,
suspension, or revocation of a previously granted security clearance or access by another agency. The DEA
determination shall not be interpreted as a direction or recommendation to the Contractor regarding the
suitability of an affected individual for employment outside the scope of DEA.

Page 2 of 10

DEA-2852.204-83 (October 2015)
If a Contractor’s employee does not perform any work under the Contract for a period of twenty-four (24)
months after ISR has issued a favorable adjudication, the Contractor’s employee will be required to submit a
new application package to the COR/TM and will need a new favorable adjudication before he or she can
perform any work under the contract.
B. CONTRACTOR’S SECURITY OFFICER:
The Contractor shall establish and maintain a security program to ensure that all requirements set forth in this
document are accomplished efficiently and effectively. The Contractor shall designate a Security Officer and
an Alternate Security Officer, in case of the primary Security Officer’s absence, with the authority and
responsibility to perform screening for public trust positions.
IV. DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS1
The Contractor shall complete and submit all mandatory documents to the COR/TM. The completed documents
will be used by ISR to initiate the background investigation conducted by OPM or to supplement the background
investigation previously conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense/Defense Security Service (DOD/DSS) or
other U.S. Government agency. The Contractor is cautioned to only submit the type and number of documents
required.
All required documents shall be submitted to the COR/TM in paper format. Required documents must not be
stapled, fastened or otherwise bound together; a paper clip or binder clip will suffice. Insert each applicant’s
documents in a separate envelope with the name of the Contractor, contract number and the applicant’s full name
and labor category on the front of the envelope. Submit the completed documents to the COR/TM at the address
provided, via hand delivery, FedEx, UPS, Express Mail, Registered Mail or Delivery Confirmation. The

C. QUESTIONNAIRE FOR PUBLIC TRUST POISITIONS (SF-85P) AND SUPPLEMENTAL
QUESTIONNAIRE FOR SELECTED POSITIONS (SF-85P-S):
Barring any questionable or disqualifying information prior to approval of the waiver, ISR will establish an eQIP account for the applicant on the OPM’s website www.opm.gov. ISR will then e-mail an “invitation” to
he applicant with instructions on logging into the OPM website and completing the Questionnaire for Public
Trust Positions (SF-85P) and Supplemental Questionnaire for Selected Positions (SF-85P-S), in e-QIP for
electronic transmission directly to ISR. The Contractor’s Security Officer will receive a copy of the
applicant’s e-QIP invitation.
The applicant will have fourteen (14) calendar days from the e-Qip “invitation” email to complete and
electronically transmit the e-QIP version of the SF-85P and SF-85P-S, sending by fax the signed signature
pages directly to ISR or sending by email the signed signature pages as PDF attachments directly to the ISR
email address provided in the e-QIP invitation. If an applicant has not completed the SF-85P and SF-85P-S in
e-QIP by the 14th calendar day, ISR will notify the COR/TM to advise the Contractor and determine the
reason. An extension will be granted only with the COR/TM and ISR’s approval. Failure to comply with the
14 calendar days will cause the entire package to be rejected and returned to the Contractor without any
further action.
ISR will review and approve or reject the SF-85P and SF-85P-S. If approved, ISR will transmit the SF-85P
and SF-85P-S to OPM electronically to schedule the background investigation. At the DEA’s discretion, ISR
may grant a waiver valid for a six (6) month period when OPM has scheduled the background investigation.
A waiver will not be granted until OPM has scheduled the background investigation.
If the SF-85P is rejected, ISR will notify the applicant and the applicant will be provided five (5) calendar
days from the date of notification to correct and transmit the required documentation.
D. APPLICANTS WITH CURRENT PUBLIC TRUST OR SECURITY CLEARANCES:
If the applicant has a favorable Public Trust Suitability Determination by another U.S. Government agency or
a Defense Security Service (“DOD/DSS”) security clearance, a copy of the document should be submitted to
he COR/TM. The Determination must indicate the type of background investigation conducted and the date i
was completed. The background investigation must have been completed no longer than five (5) years prior to
he date it is verified by DEA. The initiation of a new background investigation through the submission of an
SF-85P and SF-85P-S in e-QIP will not be required unless DEA ISR determines a more in-depth background
investigation than the one previously conducted is needed. The COR/TM will notify the contractor if a new
background investigation is necessary.
Fingerprint cards; Loyalty Oath; Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement; and Verification of U.S.
Citizenship forms are not required when:
1. the applicant has a current DOD/DSS clearance and a JPAS Verification Letter is provided; or
2. the applicant has favorable Public Trust Suitability Determination by another U. S. Governmen
agency. One (1) copy each of the SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions and SF-85P-S,
Supplemental Questionnaire for Selected Positions is still needed.

V. DISQUALIFYING FACTORS
Issues may surface concerning approval or retention of a Contractor’s applicant or employee that are no
addressed in this contract. If there is any doubt regarding the suitability of an applicant or employee, the
individual will not be approved for assignment to this or any DEA contract.
Suitability is a requirement for employment on a DEA contract as it concerns an individual’s conduct, character,
reputation, reliability, trustworthiness and/or loyalty to the United States. To be suitable, an individual’s
assignment or continued assignment on a DEA contract must be reasonably expected to accomplish DEA’s
mission.
Any one or more of the following factors—as disclosed on the SF-85P and SF-85P-S, in a personal interview with
he applicant, or as part of the background investigation—are grounds for mandatory disqualification for
assignment on a DEA contract and from further consideration for any type of assignment or employmen
involving DEA. The Contractor is responsible for interviewing each applicant and reviewing the complete public
rust package using the following criteria. If relevant mandatory disqualification information is obtained, the
requested package should not be submitted to DEA until the disqualifying information is favorably mitigated.
A. CRIMINAL RECORD:
1. conviction resulting from a felony charge(s), regardless of when the conviction occurred;
2. multiple misdemeanor convictions, regardless of when the convictions occurred;
3. one or more arrests and/or misdemeanor convictions for possession of an illegal drug(s) or for being
under the influence of an illegal drug(s);
4. pending indictments or pending criminal charges, regardless of whether the charge(s) is a felony or
misdemeanor; and/or
5. currently serving a period of probation resulting from a criminal conviction, regardless of whether the
conviction is for a felony or a misdemeanor charge.
B. ILLEGAL DRUG USE:
DEA’s mission is to enforce the Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 et seq. The illegal use of drugs by
any of its personnel, including contractor personnel, may adversely affect the performance of its mission,
create a danger to the public safety, expose the agency to civil liability, jeopardize criminal investigations and
prosecutions, lead to corruption, or undermine public confidence. Because of its law enforcemen
responsibilities and the sensitive nature of its work, DEA has a compelling obligation to ensure a workplace
hat is free of illegal drugs.
Applicants who are found, through investigation or personal admission, to have experimented with or used
narcotics or dangerous drugs, except those medically prescribed, may be disqualified for employment on a
DEA contract. Disclosed drug use will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Experimental use or use of any
narcotic or dangerous drug, including marijuana, after employment on a DEA contract is cause for
removal.
C. FALSE STATEMENTS:
A false statement is the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form or interview used to conduc
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, such as:
1. altering the condition of discharge on military documents;
2. altering college transcripts;
3. falsely completing or failing to disclose information on the SF-85P and SF-85P-S or any other
documents used in the background investigation process; and/or

Page 8 of 10

DEA-2852.204-83 (October 2015)
4. conflicting statements of drug use, either on the SF-85P and SF-85P-S, on the Drug Use Statement, or
during the background investigation.
D. DEBT- RELATED ISSUES:
Debt-related issues are the most prevalent derogatory issues found during background investigations and cause
delays in the adjudication process. The Contractor is encouraged to obtain the applicant/employee’s credi
report and have all potentially disqualifying issues mitigated prior to submitting the requested applican
package to DEA for processing.
The terms indebtedness, delinquent debt, and debt related issues mean lawful financial obligations that are jus
debts that are past due. Debt related issues raise a number of suitability and security concerns that an
individual must satisfactorily resolve before an affirmative adjudicative decision can be made.
Each applicant’s indebtedness will be reviewed on an individual basis. Court imposed judgments, defaulted
student loans, and other delinquent financial obligations imposed by law (e.g., child support payments,
Federal, state, or local taxes) are matters of serious concern. The mandatory disqualification policy applies to
hose applicants who cannot satisfactorily document their efforts to repay student loans or to pay child
support, taxes, or judgments.
In order to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq.) the
Contractor must carefully adhere to the following guidelines. The Contractor must obtain a credit report for
accounts in the applicant/employee’s name only. Do not obtain a credit report for joint accounts
This will be a “personal report for employment purposes.”
The Contractor shall provide a written notice/release to the applicant/employee that a credit report may be used
for employment purposes. The applicant/employee shall sign and date the notice/release and provide it to the
Contractor before the credit report is obtained by the Contractor. The Contractor is not authorized to obtain a
credit report prior to receipt of the signed notice/release. This signed notice/release is required in addition to
he form DOJ-555, Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports, Pursuant to the Fair Credi
Reporting Act. A copy of the signed notice/release shall be submitted to DEA with the DOJ-555.
The Contractor shall not take adverse action against the applicant/employee, based in whole or in part upon the
credit report, without first providing the applicant/employee a copy of the credit report and a written
description of the applicant/employee’s rights as described under Section 1681g of Title 15 U.S.C.
If a potentially disqualifying debt-related issue surfaces that the applicant/employee omitted from the SF-85P,
Questionnaire for Public Trust Position or SF-85P-S, Supplemental Questionnaire for Selected Positions, the
requested forms should not be submitted to DEA unless the applicant/employee can provide mitigating
information that clearly explains the omission and how the issue will be satisfactorily resolved.
E. ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNITED STATES:
Evidence of activities developed during the background investigation that would bring the applicant’s
allegiance to the United States into question, such as:
1. involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, sedition, or other act whose aim is
o overthrow the Government of the United States or alter the form of government by unconstitutional
means; and/or
2. foreign influence or preference.

Page 9 of 10

DEA-2852.204-83 (October 2015)
F. PERSONAL CONDUCT:
Evidence of any of the following activities developed during the background investigation relative to the
applicant’s conduct and integrity, such as:
1. reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other
acquaintances;
2. infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to
excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion. Sexual behavior is a concern if it involves a criminal
offense, indicates a personality disorder or emotional disorder, subjects the applicant to coercion,
exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion. Sexual orientation or preference
may not be used as a basis for, or a disqualifying factor in determining a person’s suitability;
3. illness, including any mental condition, the nature of which in the opinion of competent medical
authority may cause significant defect in the judgment or reliability of the employee, with due regard
o the transient or continuing effect of the illness and the medical findings in such case;
4. any facts which furnish reason to believe that the applicant may be subjected to coercion, influence, or
pressure which may cause him/her to act contrary to the best interest of DEA;
5. association with persons involved in criminal activity;
6. current or recent history of continuing alcohol or prescription abuse;
7. misuse of information technology systems; and/or
8. misconduct or negligence in the workplace.
A determination by DEA that a person is not suitable to perform work under the contract is not a denial,
suspension, or revocation of a previously granted security clearance by another agency, nor shall it be
interpreted as a direction or recommendation to the Contractor regarding the suitability of an affected
individual for employment outside the scope of DEA.

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or

(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).

** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization
modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or
local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
file:///C/Users/JCGirard/Downloads/Wage%20Determination%202015-4543%20Rev.%2014%20Dated%205.1.2020.txt[7/16/2020 2:03:23 PM]

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///C/Users/JCGirard/Downloads/Wage%20Determination%202015-4543%20Rev.%2014%20Dated%205.1.2020.txt[7/16/2020 2:03:23 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

file:///C/Users/JCGirard/Downloads/Wage%20Determination%202015-4543%20Rev.%2014%20Dated%205.1.2020.txt[7/16/2020 2:03:23 PM]

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."

____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which
he contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1
2017. If this contract is covered by the EO the contractor must provide employees
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work up to 56 hours of paid
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness injury or other health-related needs including preventive care; to
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill
injured or has other health-related needs including preventive care; or for
reasons resulting from or to assist a family member (or person who is like family
o the employee) who is the victim of domestic violence sexual assault or
stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.54 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $181.60 per week or
$786.93 per month

HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.22 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $168.80 per
week or $731.47 per month*

*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCAcovered contract also covered by EO 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor 3 weeks after 5 years and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor wherever employed and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4535%20(2).txt[7/16/2020 2:26:17 PM]

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4535%20(2).txt[7/16/2020 2:26:17 PM]

(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).

** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization
modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or
local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4535%20(2).txt[7/16/2020 2:26:17 PM]

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4535%20(2).txt[7/16/2020 2:26:17 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4535%20(2).txt[7/16/2020 2:26:17 PM]

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4529.txt[7/16/2020 2:30:12 PM]

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4529.txt[7/16/2020 2:30:12 PM]

(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).

** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization
modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or
local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4529.txt[7/16/2020 2:30:12 PM]

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4529.txt[7/16/2020 2:30:12 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4529.txt[7/16/2020 2:30:12 PM]

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."

____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which
he contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1
2017. If this contract is covered by the EO the contractor must provide employees
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work up to 56 hours of paid
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness injury or other health-related needs including preventive care; to
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill
injured or has other health-related needs including preventive care; or for
reasons resulting from or to assist a family member (or person who is like family
o the employee) who is the victim of domestic violence sexual assault or
stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.54 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $181.60 per week or
$786.93 per month

HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.22 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $168.80 per
week or $731.47 per month*

*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCAcovered contract also covered by EO 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 7 years and 4 weeks after 11 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor wherever employed and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4559.txt[7/16/2020 2:34:32 PM]

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4559.txt[7/16/2020 2:34:32 PM]

(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).

** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization
modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or
local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4559.txt[7/16/2020 2:34:32 PM]

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4559.txt[7/16/2020 2:34:32 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4559.txt[7/16/2020 2:34:32 PM]

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."

____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which
he contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1
2017. If this contract is covered by the EO the contractor must provide employees
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work up to 56 hours of paid
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness injury or other health-related needs including preventive care; to
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill
injured or has other health-related needs including preventive care; or for
reasons resulting from or to assist a family member (or person who is like family
o the employee) who is the victim of domestic violence sexual assault or
stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.54 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $181.60 per week or
$786.93 per month

HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.22 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $168.80 per
week or $731.47 per month*

*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCAcovered contract also covered by EO 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 7 years and 4 weeks after 11 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor wherever employed and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4561.txt[7/16/2020 2:41:32 PM]

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;

employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials

local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4561.txt[7/16/2020 2:41:32 PM]

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4561.txt[7/16/2020 2:41:32 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4561.txt[7/16/2020 2:41:32 PM]

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."

____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which
he contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1
2017. If this contract is covered by the EO the contractor must provide employees
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work up to 56 hours of paid
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness injury or other health-related needs including preventive care; to
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill
injured or has other health-related needs including preventive care; or for
reasons resulting from or to assist a family member (or person who is like family
o the employee) who is the victim of domestic violence sexual assault or
stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.54 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $181.60 per week or
$786.93 per month

HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.22 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $168.80 per
week or $731.47 per month*

*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCAcovered contract also covered by EO 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 7 years and 4 weeks after 11 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor wherever employed and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4569.txt[7/16/2020 2:46:12 PM]

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4569.txt[7/16/2020 2:46:12 PM]

(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).

** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization
modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or
local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4569.txt[7/16/2020 2:46:12 PM]

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4569.txt[7/16/2020 2:46:12 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4569.txt[7/16/2020 2:46:12 PM]

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."

____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which
he contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1
2017. If this contract is covered by the EO the contractor must provide employees
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work up to 56 hours of paid
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness injury or other health-related needs including preventive care; to
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill
injured or has other health-related needs including preventive care; or for
reasons resulting from or to assist a family member (or person who is like family
o the employee) who is the victim of domestic violence sexual assault or
stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.54 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $181.60 per week or
$786.93 per month

HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.22 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $168.80 per
week or $731.47 per month*

*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCAcovered contract also covered by EO 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor 3 weeks after 8 years and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor wherever employed and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4539.txt[7/16/2020 2:51:17 PM]

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive
administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition because this wage determination may no
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate
hen the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including
consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or
modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or

file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4539.txt[7/16/2020 2:51:17 PM]

(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).

** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization
modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.

(either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear""
materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1)
dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
file:///SBU.DEA.DOJ.GOV/UserFiles/HQEAST/JCGirard/Desktop/15-4539.txt[7/16/2020 2:51:17 PM]

of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
o pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Ac
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
he proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized
representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinen
information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
he request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks tha
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."
