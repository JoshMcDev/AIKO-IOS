STATEMENT OF WORK
1.1

BACKGROUND
The National Park Service (NPS) Commercial Services Program is responsible for the oversigh
of commercial visitor services in the national parks authorized by concession contracts,
commercial use authorizations (CUAs), and leases. A wide range of activities and services are
provided through these instruments.
A concession operation is a way of providing commercial visitor services such as food, lodging,
and retail through a third party (concessioner) within a national park. These services, provided
hrough the use of concession contracts, must be necessary and appropriate for visitor use and
enjoyment.
This Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) identifies the types of services the NPS will require to
provide comprehensive condition assessments. The specific requirements of each project will be
identified in the Call Order issued under the BPA.

1.2

PURPOSE
The NPS needs a Contractor to conduct comprehensive condition assessments which will provide
he NPS with asset life cycle information, deferred maintenance, preventative maintenance,
recurring maintenance, and component renewal tasks and costs required to maintain facilities
over the terms of the concession contracts. If applicable, depreciation (required for Possessory
Interest (PI) and Leaseholder Surrender Interest (LSI) negotiations), and future expenditures tha
may qualify for LSI are also needed and this information identified.

1.3

SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials and travel to provide comprehensive condition
assessments that identify maintenance requirements and provide cost estimates of real property
related to commercial visitor services. This includes, but is not limited to lodging, restaurants,
housing, transportation, ferry services, retail marinas, golf courses, maintained landscapes and
others in the private sector or the NPS.
The below is a general overview of the services that are required to assist the NPS in the

DEFICIENCIES AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS (Appendix III)
Document work orders for existing conditions, recommend corrective measures, and
prepare cost estimates for all deficiencies, maintenance, and component renewal
requirements (component renewal (CR), preventive maintenance (PM), componen
renewal deferred maintenance CRDM), recurring maintenance (RM), recurring
maintenance deferred maintenance (RMDM), legislatively mandated issues related to
code (LMCO), accessibility (LMAC), fire (LMFS, life safety (LMLS)) identified during
he site inspection for all Assets
The assessment might also require an underwater survey when a Marina is identified in
Appendix I (see section Other Assessments).
Tasks & Methodology
Identify and document civil, structural, life safety, accessibility, mechanical, plumbing
and electrical deficiencies and maintenance requirements for all Components identified
and recorded in Appendix II for a 25-year period. Where several components can
logically be addressed through the same work order activity, create a single work order
(assigned to an Asset) to encompass that work, for example, paint all exterior siding,
associated trim and other features. Refer to Attachment 3, “Condition Assessment Guide
for Contractors” glossary for sub-work type and deficiency criticality definitions. Refer to
Attachment 4, “Condition Assessment Inspection Guidance for Contractors” for
inspection guidance. Document recommended corrective measures for all deficiencies.
Findings that require design, planning, or compliance activities beyond this Scope of
Services should be noted and summarized in the Executive Summary and Asse
Narratives (if narratives are required).

Deficiencies – document all Immediate Personal Hazard (IPH) and Legislatively
Mandated (LM) deficiencies regardless of cost. Document all deferred
maintenance (DM), recurring maintenance deferred maintenance (RMDM) and
component renewal deferred maintenance (CRDM) deficiencies with a cost to
cure of $250 or greater. In addition to specific building deficiencies also address
deficiencies such as drainage impacting foundations, ponding water, vegetation
abutting buildings, etc.
•
•

(2)

Future maintenance requirements
•

•
•
•
(3)

Determine deficiency priority (Critical, Significant, or Minor).
Definitions are provided in Attachment 2, Condition Assessmen
Guidance.
Priority Year is the year the CA site visit occurs.

Priority Year is the year the activity first occurs. Priority Year format is
YYYY or 2016, 2017, etc. (i.e. future maintenance requirements are
sequenced based on the start year of the CA (2020) and siding needs to
be done in 3 years, the priority year is 2023).
Frequency is how often the activity occurs (every six months is entered
as .5, every year is 1, every five years is 5, etc.)
Components with a Remaining Life greater than 25 years should no
have a component renewal work order in Appendix III. They may have
preventive and/or recurring maintenance work orders
Do not include inspection work orders

Create individual work orders for each deficiency or maintenance requirement
unless several components can logically be addressed through the same work
order activity. Do not include inspection work orders. Examples are:
•
•
•
•
•

Paint all exterior walls and trim for Cabin 101
Prepare and paint all interior walls and trim in rooms 100, 101, 102, and
103

DOI AAP-0050 NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS – CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (FEB 2016)
A.

FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on
contracts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor
Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation.
One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your
contract performance as required by FAR 42.15.

B.

The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS.
CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance
evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance
Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating pas
performance as part of a source selection action.

C.

We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer (CO) with the name, position title,
phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's
past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each
person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion
of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before
returning the report to the Assessing Official (AO). Information in the report must be
protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.

National Park Service Request for Quotation 140P2120Q0016

45

D.

When your Contractor Representative(s) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an
automatically generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems
requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at https://www.cpars.gov/.

E.

Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the AO will complete an interim or
final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible a
https://www.cpars.gov/.
(1)

Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the
evaluation or return the evaluation without comment.

(2)

Your comments should focus on objective facts in the AO's narrative and should
provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.
All information provided should be reviewed for accuracy prior to submission.

(3)

F.

G.

(4)

If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the
evaluation by indicating "No comment" in the space provided, and then selecting
“Accept the Ratings and Close the Evaluation”.

(5)

Your response is due within 60 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR. On day
15, the evaluation will become available in PPIRS-RC marked as “Pending” with
or without comments and whether or not it has been closed.

(6)

If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 60 days, it will automatically be
returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was
delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor
offered comment in response to this assessment."

The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
(1)

Protect the evaluation as source selection information. After review, transmit the
evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some
reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contac
he CO for instructions.

(2)

Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the
evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.

(3)

Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional
material, pre-award surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness
reviews, or other similar purposes.

(4)

If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a
meeting in writing to the CO no later than seven days following your receipt of
he evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other
means during your 60-day review period.

A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for
your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has
been finalized.
