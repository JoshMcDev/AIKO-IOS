Background
On May 5, 2010, the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-163, was signed into law. This law enabled VA to provide
unprecedented benefits to caregivers of eligible Veterans. The law required VA to
establish a Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers for eligible
Veterans with a serious injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active
military, naval, or air service on or after September 11, 2001 (among other eligibility
criteria) and a Program of General Caregiver Support Services for eligible Veterans of
all service eras. These programs fall under the purview of VA’s national Caregiver
Support Program as outlined in VHA Directive 1152(1), Caregiver Support Program.
On June 6, 2018, the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA
Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of
2018 or the VA MISSION Act of 2018, Public Law 115-182, was signed into law.
Section 161 of this law, among other things, expands eligibility for VA’s Program of
Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to eligible Veterans with a serious
injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service
before September 11, 2001 in two phases, the first of which will begin upon VA
certifying to Congress that VA has fully implemented a required information technology
system. This law also establishes new benefits for designated primary family caregivers
of eligible Veterans under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family
Caregivers. VA is currently working on regulations to define the scope of financial

planning services and legal services under 38 U.S.C. 1720G(a)(3)(A)(ii)(IV), as
amended by section 161(a)(3) of the VA MISSION Act of 2018, under which VA is
required to provide designated primary family caregivers:
(1) financial planning services relating to the needs of injured Veterans and their
caregivers; and
(2) legal services, including legal advice and consultation, relating to the needs of
injured Veterans and their caregivers.
Under the law, these services must be provided through the use of contracts with, or the
provision of grants to, public or private entities.
The Caregiver Support Program is seeking information on and from public or private
entities that could provide financial planning and legal services on a national level, to
primary family caregivers of eligible Veterans (with a current population of 20,000 and
anticipated significant growth) participating in the Program of Comprehensive
Assistance for Family Caregivers.
Objective
Financial Planning Services:
The phrase “financial planning services relating to the needs of injured Veterans and
heir caregivers” will need to be defined through notice and comment rulemaking, but i
is possible that VA’s regulations could define it to include such things as:
 Increasing primary family caregivers’ financial literacy;
 Assisting designated primary family caregivers in developing a plan to manage
heir own personal finances to include:
o Household budget planning (such as making a budget, learning to balance
a checking account, and learning to pay bills);
o Debt management (such as assistance establishing payment plans and
credit counseling);
o Retirement planning (such as consulting on personal retirement plans,
pension planning, and investment options);
o Insurance review and counseling (such as reviewing current insurance
policies; and counseling on alternative insurance options to include health,
automobile, life, or house insurance); and
o Referrals to community resources for representation in matters no
included.
Legal Services:
Similarly, the phrase “legal services, including legal advice and consultation, relating to
he needs of injured Veterans and their caregivers” will need to be defined through
notice and comment rulemaking, but it is possible that VA’s regulations could define it to
include such things as:
 Estate planning;
 Advanced care planning;

Wills;
Trusts;
Designating a power of attorney;
Appointing a guardian for the eligible Veteran; and
Referrals to community resources for representation in matters not included.

It is also possible that VA’s definition could specifically exclude certain matters, such as:
 Representation in legal action against the United States Government or agains
he eligible Veteran; and
 Representation in criminal or civil legal matters (including matters of family law
such as divorce, child custody, and related matters).
These services will be provided by public or private entities as required by governing
statue.
It is possible that VA’s regulations could limit the number of issues or sessions relating
o this benefit for which a designated primary family caregiver is eligible, but as with the
scope of these benefits, this has not been determined and would be subject to notice
and comment rulemaking. The amounts of financial planning and legal services needed
will vary depending on the complexity of the issues being addressed and the needs of
he primary family caregiver.
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.
