Introduction
Thank you for choosing the Building Maintenance and Operations (BMO) Strategic Sourcing contracts to
fulfill your Operations and Maintenance, and Facilities Support service needs!
BMO Government-Wide Contracts consist of two different groups of awardees: BMO (unrestricted
solicitation) and BMO SB (small business set-aside solicitation). The BMO Unrestricted and the BMO
SB vehicles provide a common architecture and platform across the Federal Government for the
acquisition of Operations and Maintenance, and Facilities Support service requirements. These
requirements often necessitate the integration of several building maintenance and operations services.
See Appendix A for Service Category Definitions.

Who is this Guide Written for?
This guide is written for warranted Federal Ordering Contracting Officers (OCO’s) considering or
intending to use the BMO/BMO SB contract vehicles. It explains how BMO/BMO SB is used to satisfy
an Operations and Maintenance and/or Facilities Support service based requirement. The Guide addresses
contracting issues and concepts unique to BMO/BMO SB. As always, OCO’s shall follow FAR
regulations and their agency specific policies as well as adhere to the terms of the contract. This Guide
does not address general contracting issues or concepts unless necessary for complete understanding.
This Ordering Guide will help ordering offices to effectively use the BMO/BMO SB contracts to deliver
solutions to meet mission needs. Information to assist customer agencies in using the BMO/BMO SB
contracts is also available online at www.gsa.gov/bmo. The BMO website includes the following
resources:
● The Ordering Guide
● Document Library
● Pre-Award Scope Review process for the OCO
● Frequently Asked Questions
● List of Awarded Contractors, their MA-IDIQ contract numbers and contact information
● Training
● Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) process for the OCO
● A link to the Category Hallway

Scope of the BMO and BMO SB Contracts
The scope of BMO/BMO SB spans many areas of expertise and includes the primary services required to
provide a total solution to maintain and operate federal buildings and assets. The BMO/BMO SB
contracts are setup to allow agencies the flexibility of purchasing services individually or in combination
for a total solution. See www.gsa.gov/bmo for a listing of the awarded vendors and the service categories
for each vendor.

Services Not in Scope of BMO and BMO SB
BMO/BMO SB task orders shall not include any of the following:
● Telecommunication systems
● Furnishings (not installed as fixtures)

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide

Who Can Use BMO and BMO SB?
BMO/BMO SB contracts may be used by all Federal agencies and other entities as listed in the GSA
Order, OGP 4800.2I, Eligibility to use GSA Sources of Supply and Services, as amended.

How Do I Begin Using BMO and BMO SB?
In order to solicit and place a task order under BMO/BMO SB, the OCO must obtain a Delegation of
Procurement Authority (DPA) from the BMO/BMO SB Contracting Officer or delegated program
official. In order to do this, you must:
● Be a warranted Federal Contracting Officer (CO) in good standing
● Formally apply for and receive a DPA
○ Attend a specialized BMO/BMO SB training course

How Do I Request a DPA?
To request a DPA, please visit the “Delegation of Procurement Authority Request” section located on our
web site at www.gsa.gov/bmo. Follow complete instructions on the web site.
DPAs are issued to individuals, not to agencies at large. Agencies may have as many of its contracting
officers as it wishes apply for a DPA. Once an agency CO receives a DPA from the BMO/BMO SB CO,
he/she is officially known as an Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO). An OCO has the authority to
solicit, award, administer, and modify task orders against the BMO and BMO SB contracts on behalf of
your agency. Agency CO’s that do not have a DPA may not use another CO’s DPA as authority to solici
and award task or delivery orders.
No work may be performed, no obligation may accrue and no payment may be made against the
BMO/BMO SB contracts except as authorized by a bona-fide written order signed by an OCO having a
written, GSA issued, BMO/BMO SB DPA. A Sample DPA is provided in Appendix B for your
review. The DPA letter lists the responsibilities you must meet as an authorized user of BMO and BMO
SB contracts in order to keep your DPA active.
DPA training may be completed via conference call, meeting space, or in person depending on
circumstances. DPA’s may be revoked at the discretion of the BMO/BMO SB Contracting Officer.

Reassigning Task Orders for Administration
BMO/BMO SB task orders can only be re-assigned for administration to other agency CO’s who have
been issued a BMO/BMO SB DPA. Agencies should plan for workplace turnover and development of
qualified OCO’s to administer task orders. GSA will work with agencies to expedite training and DPA
issuance when personnel turnover is sudden and unexpected.

Roles and Responsibilities
GSA is responsible for award, administration, and management of the BMO/BMO SB contracts. Among
he responsibilities GSA will meet are:
● Monitoring and evaluation of performance against the IDIQ contract requirements by each
contract holder
● Have exclusive, non-delegable rights to modify IDIQ contract terms and conditions

Comply with the ordering procedures at FAR 16.505, including Fair Opportunity procedures a
FAR 16.505(b)(1), and other applicable agency specific regulatory supplements

The OCO must tailor all optional clauses, provisions, and other applicable terms and conditions specific
o the task order solicitation and award.

What are some of the benefits of using BMO/BMO SB?
BMO/BMO SB is flexible, easy to use, and allows agencies to:
● Utilize various contract types at the task order level: Fixed-Price (all types), Time-and-Materials,
and Labor-Hour, including hybrid mixtures of contract types
● Utilize incentives, performance based measures, multi-year and/or option periods at the task order
level
● Easily compare prices across vendors due to standardized Labor Categories based on OMB’s
Standard Occupational Classifications
● Establish CLIN structures tailored to individual task order requirements
● Help in achieving agency small business and socioeconomic goals
● Acknowledge that for other than small businesses, small business subcontracting plans have
already been approved and incorporated into the IDIQ
● Include other direct costs (ODCs) at the task order level as needed
● Access templates and sample acquisition documents
● Access transactional data and data analytics for spend analysis and market research
● Acknowledge that responsibility determinations have already been completed for all contrac
holders in accordance with FAR Part 9, at the parent contract level
● Obtain acquisition support through BMO/BMO SB website resources and the National Customer
Service Center (NCSC) customer service hotline
● Share lessons-learned and best practices

Options for Accessing the BMO/BMO SB Contracts
Orders issued against BMO/BMO SB vehicles are considered Interagency Acquisitions (except orders
issued by GSA for GSA as the requiring agency). Agencies with designated OCO’s may issue orders
directly against BMO/BMO SB or enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with a Servicing
Agency to issue the task order. MOA’s can be for cradle-to-grave services.
GSA has specific statutory authority under 40 U.S.C 501 to purchase supplies and non-personal services
on behalf of other agencies. Therefore, the Economy Act does not apply to BMO/BMO SB orders.

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide

THE ORDERING PROCESS
Step 1: Acquisition Planning
Orders against multiple-award IDIQ contracts, such as BMO/BMO SB, are not exempt from Acquisition
Planning as prescribed in FAR Part 7. Conduct market research for your requirement in accordance with
regulations as you would do with any procurement. You are encouraged to submit Requests for
Information (RFI), draft solicitations, and other documents to the BMO/BMO SB contract holders as par
of your market research efforts.
Generally, OCO’s shall follow the ordering procedures in FAR Subpart 16.505. Unless an authorized
exception applies, fair opportunity procedures prescribed for the dollar value of the task order must be
used. When the OCO plans to award an order based on an exception to fair opportunity, applicable
Justifications and Approvals should be prepared as part of the planning process. Any required notices and
postings must also be issued.

Which BMO Vehicle to Use, BMO or BMO SB?
Which BMO vehicle you will use depends on the determination made in the acquisition planning process
as to whether or not your requirement should be set-aside for small business. Agencies have differing
standards, interpretations, and policies regarding set-aside determinations. GSA encourages the practice
of considering the small business awardees to fill your requirement first. Case law suggests (see MORI
Associates- US Court of Federal Claims No. 10-298C, December 21, 2011, 102 Fed. Cl. 503) that the
determination to set-aside a procurement for Small Business or not is part of the acquisition planning
process and to be done prior to contract selection. The BMO family of contracts is structured in
accordance with this. When a Small Business set-aside is to be accomplished, use BMO SB as these
contracts are awarded exclusively to small businesses. When a Small Business set-aside will not be
accomplished, the use of BMO Unrestricted is appropriate.

Set-Asides for Socioeconomic Competition under BMO SB
BMO Small Business (SB) is a total small business set-aside contract. All orders issued under BMO SB
are automatically considered set-aside for small business as only small businesses were awarded a BMO
SB contract.
Except as otherwise stated in the 8(a) instructions section below, or unless the order solicitation explicitly
requires size/socioeconomic re-certification at the order level, the ordering contracting officer shall rely
on the size/socioeconomic status shown in the BMO SB Contractor list available here:
www.gsa.gov/bmo. All BMO SB Contractors’ size/socioeconomic status remains unchanged in each of
heir BMO SB contracts unless modified by a FAR 52.219-28 re-representation.
The ordering contracting officer has discretionary authority under FAR 19.502-4(c) and FAR
16.505(b)(2)(F) to further set-aside orders for any of the small business concerns identified in FAR
19.000(a)(3) when it is anticipated that quotes will be obtained from at least two eligible small business
concerns for which the order is to be set-aside..
Per FAR 19.000(a)(3), small business concerns eligible for competitive set-aside are identified as follows:

10

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
1. 8(a) small business participants (See “Special Instructions Regarding Orders Set-Aside
for 8(a) Competition” in the next section)
2. HUBZone small business concerns
3. Service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns
4. ** Economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concerns
eligible under the Women- owned Small Business Program and Repository
5. ** Women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program
and Repository
** EDWOSB and WOSB competitive set-asides are subject to specific North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) industry groups in which EDWOSBs and WOSBs are underrepresented.
The eligible NAICS Codes for EDWOSB and WOSB set-asides are subject to change by the SBA. See
sba.gov/wosb for the updated list of NAICS Codes to determine BMO SB Pool NAICS availability for
EDWOSB or WOSB set-asides.
When setting aside orders for socio-economic concerns, the specific small business program eligibility
requirements identified in FAR Part 19 apply. For 8(a) task orders, Ordering Contracting Officers
(OCO’s) can verify that a vendor is still active within the 8(a) program by referring to their 8(a) Program
Exit Date on the BMO matrices found here: www.gsa.gov/bmo.
Small businesses retain their small business size status and socio-economic status (with the exception of
8(a) contractors that have exited the 8(a) program) for the 5-year base period under BMO SB. If a
contractor exits the 8(a) program during the course of a task order period of performance, they maintain
heir 8(a) status for that task order as long as it was awarded while the vendor was still active in the
program. Accordingly, OCO’s should not use SAM to determine the size status applicable to a BMO SB
vendor. For BMO SB prime contractors, OCO’s should use the spreadsheet found at www.gsa.gov/bmo
in order to determine the socioeconomic status of companies on BMO SB.

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
The BMO SB contract was not set aside for participants in SBA’s 8(a) Business Development (BD)
Program. At their discretion, Contracting Officers may set aside orders for 8(a) program participants, per
FAR 19.502-4(c) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(F). In accordance with FAR 19.804-6(a), an individual order
must be offered and accepted by SBA into the 8(a) program at the task order level, if the multiple award
contract was not set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) contractors. Ordering COs should follow
he offer/acceptance procedures as provided in their agency’s SBA Partnership Agreement, and detailed
by SBA here: https://www.sba.gov/contracting/contracting-officials/sba-agencies-partnership-agreements.
Orders issued to 8(a) Business Development participants will count toward the ordering agency’s Small
Disadvantaged Business (SDB) goals.
Suggested Solicitation Language
Below is suggested solicitation language when setting aside orders for 8(a) competition under BMO SB:
This task order under BMO SB is 100 % set-aside for 8(a) SBA Business Development Program
Participants. Only BMO SB contractors designated as an 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Business in their
BMO SB contract are eligible to compete.
Competition Considerations
Keep in mind that setting aside orders to SBA 8(a) Business Development Program (BD) participants
may reduce competition, as it requires verification from SBA prior to the award of an order, that a
concern is an eligible 8(a) participant in accordance with 13 CFR 124.503 (h)(2)(iv). As a result, BMO
SB 8(a) contractors whose 8(a) program term has expired will be ineligible for award of the order.
Note: For orders awarded in accordance with FAR 19.8, and not specifically set aside for 8(a) BD
participants, ordering agencies will receive credit toward their SDB goals for awards made to contractors
designated as 8(a) under the BMO contract, regardless of their current status in the 8(a) program.
According to FAR 19.804-6 (c), “agencies may continue to take credit toward their prime contracting
small disadvantaged business or small business goals for orders awarded to 8(a) participants, even after
he contractor’s 8(a) program term expires, the contractor otherwise exits the 8(a) program, or the
contractor becomes other than small for the NAICS code assigned under the 8(a) contract.” Note
however, that if an 8(a) contractor re-represents as other than small in accordance with FAR 19.301-2, the
ordering agency may not credit subsequent orders to that contractor towards the agency’s small
disadvantaged business or small business goals.
In the event of any regulatory changes during the duration of BMO SB, the BMO SB CO reserves the
right to unilaterally modify BMO SB to reflect the change at no additional cost to the Government.
How to Set-Aside for 8(a) and Receive 8(a) Credi
STEP 1: Determine your requirements:
A. Determine the anticipated total value of the task order, including options.
·
If your requirement exceeds the $4 million competitive threshold, then determine if a
competitive 8(a) set-aside can be accomplished [IAW FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F)]. No
justification is required by the FAR when using fair opportunity Exception (F).
B. Determine the service category(ies) needed for task order performance.
·
Competitive 8(a) Set-Aside: There must be 2 or more active 8(a) businesses awarded ALL
of the service categories required for your task order.
STEP 2: Research your procurement’s history:

12

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
If your requirement has been procured previously, or is not a new requirement, it is important to
know the procurement history. Requirements that have previously been awarded to an 8(a)
company are required to stay within the 8(a) program, unless released by the SBA. However, tha
does not mean they are required to be awarded to the incumbent 8(a) company.
There are circumstances in which a requirement can be released from the 8(a) program. SBA
regulations at 13 CFR 124.504(d), Release for non-8(a) competition, requires the procuring
activity to submit a written request to, and receive concurrence from, the Associate Administrator
for the Office of Business Development (AA/BD) to be released from the 8(a) program. In
addition to other factors that SBA will consider in releasing a requirement, SBA will not concur
unless the procuring activity agrees to procure the requirement as a small business, HUBZone,
SDVOSB, or WOSB set-aside.
Follow-on or re-compete contracts:
●
If there is 8(a) availability under BMO SB for the requirement, the OCO can
conduct an 8(a) procurement under BMO SB and a release is not required from the
8(a) program.
●
If the OCO cannot conduct an 8(a) procurement under BMO SB but can setaside the requirement for a socio-economic category on the BMO SB, the OCO mus
obtain concurrence from the AA/DB to be released from the 8(a) program.
STEP 3: Evaluation, Offering and Acceptance:
Once the decision has been made to do an 8(a) procurement under BMO SB, “evaluation,
offering, and acceptance” (FAR Subpart 19.804) must be completed at the 8(a) BMO SB task
order level in order to receive 8(a) credit. Follow the offer/acceptance procedures for your
agency detailed by SBA here: https://www.sba.gov/contracting/contracting-officials/sbaagencies-partnership-agreements. This process is not unique to BMO but is required for any
procurement under the 8(a) program. This is only required for procurements that are specifically
for the 8(a) program. This is not a required step for an 8(a) vendor to receive an award under a
small business set-aside of any other socioeconomic type. The OCO should consider this when
planning the acquisition timeline. FAR 19.804 Subpart prescribes the steps for this process.

Task Order Contract Types
Subject to FAR and agency level required consideration criteria, limitations, and/or prohibitions, you may
use any appropriate contract type(s) to include:
● Fixed-Price, all types
● Time-and-materials
● Labor-Hour
● Hybrid of any of these types
If you elect to use a hybrid of contract types, please use separate line item number for the work under
each contract type and annotate each line item with the associated contract type. This is important for
clause implementation.

Assign a NAICS Code to Each Order
All contracts under BMO/BMO SB were awarded using NAICS 561210 and the associated small
business size standard of $38.5M. The OCO may use the IDIQ Contract NAICS (561210) and associated
size determination ($38.5M) at the task order level or select a more specific NAICS depending on the

13

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
requirement. The chart below identifies the 24 NAICS codes and associated size standards awarded

Task Order Funding and Funding Limitations
All task orders must be funded by the agency requiring and requesting services under BMO/BMO SB.
However, orders placed under BMO/BMO SB may not be used to circumvent conditions and limitations
imposed on the use of funds.

Allowance for Unexpected Repairs
14

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
How could an Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) allow for unexpected repairs under a BMO
Task Order (TO)?
Two potential approaches include:
1. Including a Not to Exceed (NTE) Time and Materials (T&M) Other Direct Costs (ODC’s)
Contract Line Item Number (CLIN)
2. Issuing a Logical Follow-On Task Order in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C)
See Appendix I and the Acquisition Gateway for some samples of possible approaches.
The OCO shall follow FAR and agency specific guidance on determine their approach to address
unexpected repairs.

Security Clearance Considerations for Task Orders
The task order solicitation should clearly express all requirements for security clearances and facility
clearance levels. The OCO will add their security requirements (Government Furnished Equipment,
facility and personnel), clauses, provisions, and other applicable terms and conditions specific to each
ask order solicitation and award.

Task Order Duration
The period of performance for each task order awarded under BMO/BMO SB shall be specified in the
ask order by the ordering agency. Task orders must be solicited and awarded prior to the expiration of
he BMO/BMO SB contracts and may extend up to 5 years after the BMO/BMO SB contract term
expires.
Task order option periods may be exercised after the BMO/BMO SB term expires as long as the final task
order option period does not extend the cumulative term of the task order beyond 5 years after the
expiration of the BMO/BMO SB contract term.
After the BMO/BMO SB contract terms expire, the BMO/BMO SB contracts will remain active for
administration only. The BMO/BMO SB contracts shall govern the terms and conditions of active task
orders to the same extent as if they were completed during the BMO/BMO SB term.

Minimum and Maximum Order Limitations
The minimum order limitation on this contract is $2,500. The Government is not obligated to purchase
and the contractor is not required to furnish services valued at less than $2,500. The maximum order
limitation is $15B for Phase I and $27B for Phase II.

Task Order Size Representation
The BMO/BMO SB program office maintains a list on the BMO website that provides the business size
classification for each contractor as it pertains to their BMO/BMO SB contract. These lists are accessible
by links found on the BMO Web Page (www.gsa.gov/bmo).

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide

Labor Categories for Task Order Work
In preparation for developing the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) of performance, the task order
solicitation and preparing for any negotiations that may be necessary with potential Offerors requirements
personnel should determine the array of labor categories that are necessary to perform the task order
work.
The list of BMO/BMO SB Labor Categories and Definitions is found in Appendix C. Each Labor
Category identifies the specific Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) occupations mapped to tha
Labor Category.
Other Direct Costs (ODC) Suppor
Other ODC support, integral and necessary as part of a total integrated solution within the scope of
BMO/BMO SB for which there is not a labor category specified in BMO/BMO SB or includes other
direct costs such as travel, materials, equipment, subcontractors, etc., to obtain a total service solution, are
allowable costs and may be included within an individual task order under BMO/BMO SB. The
Contractor should propose and identify each other direct costs separately and the OCO should identify
each ODC support service or other direct costs by a separate CLIN on the task order award. Agencies
should follow agency specific policies as well as FAR Subpart 16.505 and FAR Part 6 regarding
competition requirements as it relates to ODCs.

Labor on T&M and L-H Task Orders
The Contractor may provide separate and/or blended loaded hourly labor rates for prime Contractor labor,
each Subcontractor, and/or each Division, Subsidiary, or Affiliate in accordance with the provisions se
forth in FAR 52.216-29, FAR 52.216-30, or FAR 52.216-31. The OCO must identify which provision is
applicable in the task order solicitation and/or Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). T&M and L-H task
orders require the BMO/BMO SB standardized labor categories and their associated rates to be identified
in the task order award document. Other Direct Costs (ODC’s) subcontract labor shall be proposed and
awarded as Materials in accordance with FAR 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and LaborHour Contracts.
When preparing solicitations for T&M and/or L-H task order line items, the OCO must include the
following provision in the task order solicitation.
FAR 52.216-31 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements--Commercial Item
Acquisition
For organizations within DoD, when selecting FAR 52.216-29, the OCO must also select the appropriate
DFAR’s clause (such as 252.216-7002, Alternate A). OCO’s shall always follow their agency’s internal
guidelines including required justifications and/or approvals for use of this contract type.
In accordance with BMO/BMO SB Section B.2.4, the pricing associated with the BMO/BMO SB Labor
Categories are fully burdened, ceiling rates for T&M or L-H task orders since the base rate does no
change with the delivery location for exempt (professional) labor categories. Contractors may offer
pricing that is lower than the ceiling rates at the task order level.

16

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide

Service Category Labor Standards (SCLS)
The BMO/BMO SB labor categories are subject to the Service Category Labor Standards (SCLS)
(formerly known as Service Contract Act/SCA) in accordance with FAR Subpart 22.10 and other
applicable agency specific regulatory supplements. The OCO must identify such work in the task order
solicitation and make a determination as to whether the SCLS wage determinations are to be applied or
not. BMO/BMO SB includes clauses applicable to any SCLS work that is within the scope of
BMO/BMO SB.

Wage Rate Requirements
In some instances, including those that involve ODC’s, where construction, alteration and repair are
within the scope of BMO/BMO SB requirements may be subject to the Wage Rate Requirements
(formerly known as Davis Bacon Act/DBA) in accordance with FAR Subpart 22.4 and other applicable
agency specific regulatory supplements. The OCO must identify such work in the task order solicitation
and make a determination as to whether the Wage Rate Requirement determinations are to be applied or
not. The OCO is responsible for ensuring that construction, alterations, or repairs are covered by the
purpose element of the appropriation used to fund the construction portion of the task order.
BMO/BMO SB does NOT include clauses applicable to any construction, alteration, or repair work that is
part of a total solution within the scope of BMO/BMO SB. Subsequently, the OCO must incorporate the
appropriate clauses and provisions in each task order solicitation and subsequent award when the Wage
Rate Requirements, Bond Information and Miller Act applies.
The OCO shall identify construction under a separate line item on their task order. The OCO is
encouraged to price these services on a firm-fixed-price basis per FAR 36.207(a). The OCO must also
include all applicable construction clauses and wage decisions in the task order.

Rights Reserved by the Procuring Contracting Officer
The BMO/BMO SB CO is the sole and exclusive GSA Government official with actual authority to
administer and/or modify the BMO/BMO SB contract terms and conditions, monitor the Contractor’s
performance in the areas of contract compliance and contract administration, and assist the Contractor and
OCO on matters related to the BMO/BMO SB terms and conditions. The BMO/BMO SB CO may
delegate routine administrative functions to an authorized BMO/BMO SB representative.
The OCO for each task order may designate a Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to perform
specific administrative or technical functions. The specific rights and responsibilities of the COR for each
ask order shall be described in writing, which upon request, shall be provided to the Contractor. A COR
has no actual, apparent, or implied authority to bind the Government. OCOs may not transfer delegation
of procurement authority to a non-delegated Contracting Officer.

Contract Access Fee (CAF)
The BMO/BMO SB CAF shall be included in each task order under a separate and distinct line item for
he base year and each option period (if applicable). In response to all task order solicitations, regardless
of contract type, the Contractor shall always propose a CAF rate of 2% of the total estimated task order
price, including options.

17

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
The CAF is to be included on each invoice as 2% of the total invoiced product and/or services charges.
The CAF will be paid by the customer agency to the Contractor. The Contractor will report (monthly) and
submit (quarterly) that collected CAF to GSA.
No later than January 15th of each calendar year, the BMO Program Office will notify the Contractor if
here are any changes to the CAF rate.

Other Significant Planning Considerations
Other key considerations to address in developing your acquisition plan and preparing for task order
solicitation include:
● Economy Act - does not apply to BMO/BMO SB task orders; GSA is specifically authorized by
law to purchase supplies or non-personal service on behalf of other agencies. No documentation
is required unless mandated by your agency’s policy.
● Inherently Governmental Functions - FAR 7.503(e) stipulates that the requirements official shall
provide to the OCO, concurrent with the statement of work, a written determination that none of
he functions to be performed are Inherently Governmental.
● Personal Services - FAR 37.104 characterizes personal services contracts as an employeeemployer relationship between the Government and contractor’s personnel. The Government is
normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under competitive appointment or other
procedures required by civil service laws. Obtaining personal services by contract, rather by
direct hire, circumvents those laws unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the
services by contract. Personal services are NOT authorized on BMO/BMO SB.
● Performance-based contracting methods are preferred
● Identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest (COI).
● Preparation of a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan and identification of performance metrics,
as applicable.
● Evaluation Factors
● Source Selection Methodology

BMO Tools and Planning Resources
As an authorized user of BMO/BMO SB, agencies have access to a number of tools and resources found
in the BMO Web library which can be accessed through the link on the BMO home page a
www.gsa.gov/bmo. Appendix E, BMO Tools & Resources, describes some of the resources available
on the BMO/BMO SB website. These resources are constantly being edited, changed and updated to
better assist agencies with their requirements.

Cancellation of Requirements
Cancellation of a task order solicitation is at the discretion of the OCO. However, any cancellation of
ask order solicitation should be given serious consideration prior to cancellation. It is a good practice for
he OCO to document the cancellation decision rationale and communicate the rationale with the affected
BMO/BMO SB Service Group contractors.

Pre-solicitation Scope Reviews
Task orders under BMO/BMO SB must be within the scope of the IDIQ contract as discussed in the
section on “Scope of the BMO/BMO SB Contracts”. GSA offers, and strongly encourages OCO’s to take

18

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
advantage of, task order pre-solicitation scope reviews. This review will ensure your requirement is being
placed under the appropriate contract vehicle. Reviews may be requested through the BMO website.
BMO will complete or contact the customer for more information within 48 hours of the scope review
request.

Step 2: Define the Requirements and Develop the
Solicitation
Requirements Development Support Resources
Agencies have access to a considerable array of support resources during the requirements developmen
phase. GSA’s Assisted Acquisition Service (AAS) may be available to support your agency in task order
solicitation, including defining your requirements and developing the solicitation package. Alternatively,
for those agencies that prefer to perform these functions in-house, numerous aids are available online a
he BMO Web library, including, but not limited to:
● The Ordering Guide
● Document Library
● Pre-Award Scope Review process for the OCO
● Frequently Asked Questions
● List of Awarded Contractors, their MA-IDIQ contract numbers and contact information
● Training
● Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) process for the OCO
● A link to the Category Hallway

The BMO/BMO SB Estimating Tool
GSA anticipates providing an automated pricing tool to assist in developing task order IGE’s. It is under
development but should cover all occupations in the OMB’s Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)
system that is mapped to BMO Labor Categories’ pricing. The estimating tool once developed will be
available through the GSA BMO website found at www.gsa.gov/bmo.

Developing the Solicitation
Use the solicitation form and format for task orders normally prescribed and used by your agency for task
order solicitations, consistent with FAR 16.505 procedures. In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii) Fair
Opportunity, “the contracting officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum.” FAR
16.505(b)(1) states that the contracting officer must: (A) Develop placement procedures that will provide
each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order and reflect the requirement and other
aspects of the contracting environment; (B) Not use any method (such as allocation or designation of any
preferred awardee) that would not result in a fair consideration being given to all awardees prior to
placing each order; (C) Tailor the procedures to each acquisition; (D) Include the procedures in the
solicitation and the contract; and (E) Consider price or cost under each order as one of the factors in the
selection decision. FAR 16.505(b)(1) also provides additional Fair Opportunity requirements for
different dollar thresholds. Please be sure to reference the FAR during solicitation development.

19

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
In addition to the typical content of your solicitation, certain information particular to using BMO/BMO
SB appropriately should be added, emphasized, or highlighted in your solicitation. That information will
be discussed and explained in the succeeding paragraphs. A Task Order Solicitation Template is provided
in Appendix F for consideration. Additional samples may be found on the Acquisition Gateway.
In addition to the information required by FAR 16.505(a)(7), all task order solicitations shall provide the
following information at a minimum:
● Applicable NAICS, PSC Code, and Service Category(ies) covered
● SOW/PWS/SOO
● Contract Line Item Number Information
● Evaluation Factors
● Source Selection Methodology
● Contract Type(s)
● Period of Performance
● Place of Performance
● Proposal Due Date
● Proposal Instructions
● Other Pertinent Information (for example: agency specific clauses, optional clauses, etc.)

Clauses and Provisions
All Applicable and Required provisions/clauses set forth in FAR 52.301 automatically flow down to all
BMO/BMO SB task orders, based on their specific contract type, statement of work, and dollar value. All
Applicable and Required provisions/clauses that automatically flow down to task orders shall remain
unchanged, throughout the entire period of performance under BMO/BMO SB. If a future Applicable or
Required provision/clause are to the benefit of future task orders solicited under BMO/BMO SB, the
future Applicable or Required provision/clause may be updated by FAC No. and effective date under a
bilateral modification to BMO/BMO SB.
In accordance with FAR 8.005, the OCO shall, “Insert the clause at 52.208-9, Contractor Use of
Mandatory Sources of Supply and Services, in solicitations and contracts that require a contractor to
provide supplies or services for Government use that are on the Procurement List maintained by the
Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.” For certain task orders
where supplies are anticipated to be supplied for use by the Government, the Procurement List maintained
by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is a mandatory source
of supply and should be checked to see if these supplies are available from this source.
The OCO may identify any Optional, and/or Agency-Specific provisions/clauses for each individual task
order solicitation and subsequent award. The OCO must provide the provision/clause Number, Title,
Date, and fill-in information (if any), as of the date the task order solicitation is issued.

Emergency Services
Emergency Services and response timeframes may be designated at the task order level. The OCO shall
specify all requirements for Emergency Services at the task order level.

Evaluation Factors
In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii), the policies in FAR Subpart 15.3 (Source Selection) DO NOT
apply to the MA IDIQ ordering process. In addition, “The contracting officer may exercise broad
20

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures. The contracting officer should keep
submission requirements to a minimum. Contracting officers may use streamlined procedures, including
oral presentations.”
The task order solicitation and award process should be as streamlined as practical to reduce solicitation
and proposal preparation costs and time for both the Government and the Contractor, respectively.

Step 3: Issue the Solicitation
Methods of Issuing the Task Order Solicitation
A BMO/BMO SB task order solicitation may be issued by:
● Posting the notice on GSA’s e-Buy at www.ebuy.gsa.gov
● Through the ordering agency’s preferred method
In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(i) Fair Opportunity, “The contracting officer must provide each
awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,500 issued under multiple
delivery-order contracts or multiple task-order contracts, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2).” The
use of any one of the preceding mediums to broadcast an RFP notice to all contract holders providing the
service categories needed satisfies the fair opportunity notification requirement.

Contractors in Dormant Status
The BMO/BMO SB terms allow GSA to place contractors in a dormant status while they develop
corrective measures for the BMO/BMO SB CO to review and approve. During dormancy, contractors
may continue to work on existing task orders awards, but are prohibited from competing for new task
order awards. GSA will maintain a list of contractors in dormant status. If conducting a sole source
procurement, the OCO should check with the BMO program office prior to solicitation to determine if the
contractor is in dormant status. Upon receipt of solicitation for competitive procurements, the
BMO/BMO SB CO will notify the OCO if any contractors in the applicable service group are under
Dormant Status.

Step 4: Evaluate Proposals
OCO’s should evaluate proposals based on the methodology stated in the task order solicitation to
maintain fairness in the ordering process and mitigate protest risk.

Price
The OCO is responsible for analyzing order proposals and documenting the price evaluation to include a
determination that the final agreed to price is fair and reasonable, irrespective of contract type(s). When
adequate price competition exists generally no additional information is necessary to determine price
reasonableness. However, OCO’s are encouraged to negotiate additional discounts off of the awarded
rates.
NOTE: All costs associated with the preparation, presentation, and discussion of the Contractor’s
proposal in response to a task order solicitation will be at the Contractor’s sole and exclusive expense.
Vendors shall not seek reimbursement for proposal preparation costs at the task order level.

21

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide

Tier Pricing Discounts
Policy established by the Office and Management and Budget (OMB M-13-02) requires that, at a
minimum, tiered pricing is a characteristic that must be included in a government-wide strategic sourcing
vehicle. The BMO/BMO SB contracts required contractors to offer discounts for the following tiered
pricing structure which will have associated volume discounts at the task order level.
These discounts are NOT for cumulative order values, they are only offered for the value of each
individual task order. For a single task order, each offeror will offer percentage discounts based on the
following tiered structure:
For BMO, the tiers are as follows:
●
●
●

Tier 1 - $1M - $4,999,999
Tier 2 - $5M - $9,999,999
Tier 3 - $10M+

For BMO SB, the tiers are as follows:
●
●
●

Tier 1 - $500K - $999,999
Tier 2 - $1M - $1,999,999
Tier 3 - $12M+

The awarded discounts to the tiers will be based on a single task order total value. The contractor will be
responsible for providing the awarded discounts when the total task order value falls within the ranges of
he tiered structure mentioned above. If a modification to a task order increases the value into a Tier
range, the discount would apply from the modification effective date forward and would not be
retroactive.

Identification of Labor Categories
The Contractor shall identify both Prime and Subcontractor labor using the BMO/BMO SB Labor
Categories and corresponding SOC Number that applies found in Appendix C, Standardized Labor
Categories and Definitions.
Additionally, the following qualification chart applies:
All Labor Categories (excluding Project Management and Engineering)

Contractors may deviate from the definitions above when responding to task order solicitations so long as
he deviations are clearly identified in their task order proposal. For example, a Contractor might label an
employee as “Level IV”, but the employee does not have a college degree. Likewise, a Contractor migh
label an employee as “Level II” even though the employee has more than 2 years experience. Deviations
shall be clearly identified in proposals submitted in response to task order solicitations.

Step 5: Award the Task Order
Order Award Documentation
Document your task order awards in accordance with regulation and local policy.

GSA Task Order Award and Modification Information
The OCO is encouraged to submit all task order award and modification data to the BMO program office
at fssi.bmo@gsa.gov within 30 calendar days of award
A copy of the Task Order Award Information Form and the Task Order Modification Information Form
are provided at Appendix G (Award) and Appendix H (Modifications) for your review.

Public Notice of Awards Not Providing for Fair Opportunity
For orders based on an exception to fair opportunity, the OCO must post the required public notice in
accordance with procedures found at FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D). Note the actions excluded from this
requirement are disclosures that would compromise national security and small business set-asides
authorized by FAR subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).

Order Level Protests
The OCO is encouraged to contact the BMO/BMO SB CO for any BMO/BMO SB related assistance
including assistance with disputes, claims, or protests under BMO/BMO SB. However, the OCO is
responsible for resolving any performance issues, disputes, claims, or protests at the task order level.
FAR subpart 16.505(a)(10) prohibits protests under FAR subpart 33.1 in connection with the issuance or
proposed issuance of task orders against an MA IDIQ contract except for:

24

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide
●
●

a protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period of performance, or maximum
value of the contract; or
a protest on orders valued in excess of $10 million.

FAR 16.505(a)(10)(i)(B) grants sole authority to hear protests of orders in excess of $10 million and filed
in accordance with the procedures at FAR subpart 33.104 to the GAO.

Ombudsman
At the IDIQ contract level, subject to GSAM 552.216-74, GSA has appointed the required Ombudsman
o resolve complaints related to fair opportunity in the ordering process consistent with the procedures of
BMO/BMO SB and to review BMO/BMO SB CO decision to place a Contractor in Dormant Status.
You can find more information about GSA’s Procurement Ombudsman as well as the contact information
for the GSA Procurement Ombudsman can be at http://www.gsa.gov/ombudsman.

Reporting Task Order Awards in FPDS-NG
Task order awards shall be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System – Next Generation (FPDSNG) within 3 days after execution of the action. This is applicable even to agencies that may not be
required to create FPDS-NG reports (i.e. agencies that do not use appropriated funds), as the Service
Contract Reporting (SCR) link in SAM.GOV is activated based on FPDS-NG data. It is important tha
each BMO/BMO SB task order is reported as an order under the correct BMO/BMO SB contract number,
identifying the appropriate NAICS Code and PSC.
It is also important that FPDS-NG accurately reflects the requirements ordered and task order solicitation
procedures used against BMO/BMO SB. To that end, several of the many data elements in the FPDS
merit discussion. These discussions are based on the FPDS-NG Data Element Dictionary, Version 1.4.4,
dated June 28, 2013. If a more current Data Dictionary is in force at the time or your task order, adjus
he guidance accordingly.
To ensure that your agency gets proper credit for your awards, make sure your FPDS-NG repor
accurately reflects the appropriate values in fields related to award data.
NAICS Codes: The FPDS-NG system will propagate the NAICS code field in your task order action
report with the NAICS code reported for the IDIQ contract. This field cannot be changed at the task order
level within FPDS-NG.
PSC Codes: Report the PSC code from the PSC’s that you identified in the task order solicitation. The
BMO/BMO SB Product Service Codes (PSC’s) Table is provided in Appendix D.
Solicitation Procedures: (FPDS-NG data element 10M) Select “MAFO” (Multiple-Award Fair
Opportunity) as the value for this data element.
Fair Opportunity/Limited Sources: (FPDS-NG data element 10R) if the task order was competed under
fair opportunity procedures, select “FAIR” as the value for this element if an exception (A through E) to
fair opportunity was used, select the appropriate code under this data element for the exception tha
applies. For direct task order awards, use the value “SS” (sole source).

25

BMO and BMO SB Ordering Guide

Within 30 days after a task order award, use the form at Appendix G, Task Order Award Information
Form to report the action to GSA.

Step 6: Administer the Order/Execute the Work/Close-out
Quality Assurance - Contractor Surveillance
The OCO is responsible for ensuring contractor performance meets the minimum requirements
established in the order, documenting the order file and communicating with the contractor to ensure the
Government is receiving the contracted services. Monitoring contractor performance may be delegated to
a contracting officer’s representative (COR). The specific authority/limitations of the COR should be
delineated in an appointment letter, a copy of which should be provided to the contractor.

Subcontracting and Limitations on Subcontracting
BMO/BMO SB includes the following FAR Clause incorporated by reference at the MA-IDIQ contrac
level: 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (NOV 2011).

Performance Evaluation
Each OCO is responsible for ensuring that the contractor’s performance on each order is reported in
CPARS in accordance with the policies in FAR subpart 42.15. Follow your agency procedures for
preparation, review, and submission of performance reports. GSA will consider task order performance
information as part of performance evaluations at the IDIQ contract level. Task order performance may
also be considered in placing contractors in a dormant status.

Reporting Modifications in FPDS-NG
All task order modifications (involving price or scope changes) must be reported in FPDS-NG. This is
applicable even to agencies that may not be required to create FPDS-NG reports (i.e. agencies that do no
use appropriated funds), as the Service Contract Reporting (SCR) link in SAM.GOV is activated based on
FPDS-NG data.

Reporting Modifications to GSA
Within 30 days after awarding a task order modification (involving to price or scope changes), use the
form at Appendix H, Task Order Modification Information Form to report the action to GSA.

Task Order Closeout
Task order files shall be closed out in accordance with the policies in FAR subpart 4.804-1 or, if the task
order is administered by another office, 4.804-2. The procedures prescribed in 4.804-5 shall be used
except when it is appropriate to use the quick closeout procedures in FAR subpart 42.708.

APPENDIX B: SAMPLE DPA
MEMORANDUM FOR:

Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO)

FROM:

Josilyn Reed
BMO/BMO SB Contracting Officer
Phone
email

SUBJECT:

Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) as OCO to Compete,
Award, and Administer BMO and BMO SB task orders

The purpose of this DPA is to ensure that the roles and responsibilities between the BMO and BMO SB
CO’s and the OCO are clearly established in order to ensure proper use of the BMO vehicles while
promoting public policy objectives.
GSA retains sole responsibility to administer and modify the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity
(IDIQ) contracts. GSA will evaluate the performance of BMO and BMO SB contractors against the IDIQ
contract terms. It will also provide advice and guidance to agencies/OCOs on all BMO and BMO SB
procurement matters.
The authority granted to you under this DPA is limited to those requirements of your agency that are
within scope of the BMO vehicles. Your authority to administer BMO and BMO SB task orders covers
all task orders awarded by you or another OCO possessing a valid DPA in your current warranting
organization. The DPA authority does not extend to administration of task orders awarded by OCOs
outside your current warranting organization unless:
1. Your agency is a servicing agency as defined in OMB Memorandum “Improving the
Management and Use of Interagency Acquisitions, June 6, 2008; and,
2. Your agency enters into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Agency that awarded the task
order in accordance with FAR 17.502-1(b)(1) specifically for administration only of the task
order.
You will act as the central point of contact under each task order and are responsible for coordinating with
he awarded Contractor, the Client (the funding organization/receiver of goods or services) and GSA.
This applies regardless of whether your contracting organization is acting as the Servicing Agency on
behalf of a client outside your agency or is within the requiring Agency and is contracting for its own
requirement. You will perform all required pre and post award functions associated with the task order
subject to the following terms and conditions of this DPA:
1. Compliance - You are expected to comply with the BMO and BMO SB terms and conditions, the
BMO and BMO SB ordering guides, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the

Duration - This DPA is applicable for all BMO/BMO SB Zones and shall remain in effect until
he expiration of all BMO/BMO SB contracts or completion and closeout of any awarded task
orders whose duration extends beyond the expiration of the contract, whichever is later. You are
also required to maintain a valid warrant authority. Notwithstanding the preceding, this DPA is
portable under certain conditions. If you change organizations within the larger Agency, or move
o a new Agency but will continue to be warranted, the DPA is portable. However, you mus
notify the BMO/BMO SB COs of the move or reassignment and provide information on the new
warrant when it is issued. Re-training is not required unless there is a break of more than ninety
days in possession of a current warrant or serving in a Contracting Officer position. The DPA
cannot be re-delegated.
Revocation - GSA may revoke this DPA at any time for failure to comply with treaty, law,
regulation, ethical standards and applicable federal acquisition policies and procedures. GSA will
be cognizant of the need to ensure task order continuity if such actions are initiated.
Scope Compliance - Ensure that task order work is within the BMO or BMO SB scope. The
BMO program team is available to assist with this determination at any time upon request.
Administrative Reporting - Upon award, OCOs are responsible for reporting the task order
award action in the Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation (FPDS-NG). In addition
o FPDS-NG reporting, OCOs are encouraged to provide a complete copy of the task order, e.g.,
he signature page, the work statement and the line items (equivalent to Sections A-J of the

Sample 2 – Logical Follow-on
IAW FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), Exceptions to the Fair Opportunity Process, the OCO may issue a
follow-on TO on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a
logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were
given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. OCO’s should consider inserting
he following language in the original SOW: “Additional repairs under this TO may be performed
by the awardee IAW FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C).” Under this approach, the OCO would negotiate
and issue a follow-on TO, for repairs when needed. OCO’s shall ensure compliance with FAR
16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), which deals with exceptions to the fair opportunity process, and (b)(2)(ii),
which deals with justification, approval, and posting requirements for issuing a follow-on TO.
