About the SCRIPTS BPAs
The SCRIPTS BPAs are a competitively awarded suite of secure supply chain risk
illumination tools and services BPAs. This full suite of subscription-based business
intelligence tools and professional analytic support services offer total solutions tha
assess findings and inform organizational risk management strategies.
The SCRIPTS BPAs were established to assist federal agencies in gaining greater
insight into their federal supply chain, including the health of industry suppliers and
potential risks they may introduce into the supply chain. The SCRIPTS BPAs enable
customers to acquire supply chain risk management solutions from highly qualified
businesses. Agencies can leverage SCRIPTS BPAs to holistically screen and ve
vendors’ underlying supply chain networks/affiliated personnel to ensure suppliers are
reputable, in good-standing, financially and operationally secure, and will not introduce
unacceptable risks to the government.
SCRIPTS BPAs Layman’s
Terms Explanation
The SCRM illumination tools and services available through the SCRIPTS BPAs
are in a sense a credit report of risks for companies, individuals, third parties,
supply chains, etc. just like the reports lending institutions run on individuals to
determine whether the individual is “creditworthy”. Through the use of the
SCRIPTS BPAs, agencies will have the ability to analyze and discover risks
hrough web-based tools and professional reports. Like Equifax®, Transunion®,
and ExperianTM, each SCRM tool will identify and report slightly differen
perspectives of risks and vulnerabilities. Government agencies will receive this
information in a clear, concise format, facilitating rapid and informed decisionmaking.
Why are there eight BPAs (inclusive of one Contractor Teaming Arrangemen
(CTA)) and eight different web-based SCRM tools to choose from? Like credi
reports, where a bank seeks a comprehensive understanding of a borrower’s
creditworthiness, the use of multiple web-based SCRM tools provides a
comprehensive understanding of an agency’s supply chain vulnerabilities to
fraud, abuse, and adversarial exploitation.

6

Why SCRIPTS?
Government supply chains are essential for U.S. economic and national security,
supporting all critical infrastructure, yet they are often targeted by adversaries.
Ransomware attacks on government agencies surged 74% in 20231, making them the
hird-most targeted sector2. The $9.36 million average cost of a data breach can disrup
vital services like transportation, healthcare, emergency response, and defense.
A key step in strengthening America's security is to fortify its supply chains. Through the
use of the SCRIPTS BPAs, agencies can access an industrial base of highly qualified
contractors, robust supply chain risk analysis platforms/solutions, and professional
analytic support services. The SCRIPTS BPAs equip agencies with powerful business
intelligence tools and expert analytic support, enabling them to identify and mitigate
risks before they materialize. These resources, including vendor vetting, supply network
assessment, and real-time monitoring, protect vital supply chains from fraud, abuse,
and exploitation, and ensure that our suppliers are reliable, financially secure, and
operationally resilient, thus prioritizing the nation's security and interests.

Global supply chain threats are
increasing:
• Counterfeit products
• Prohibited Chinese telecom products
• Prohibited white label products
• Prohibited software (e.g. Kaspersky)

The DoD is tasked by the Federal
Acquisition Security Council (FASC) with:
• Determining the risk to the IT supply
chain
• Disseminating supply chain risk
information
• Deciding what actions to take to
mitigate the risk

Impact on National Security:
• Intellectual property theft risk
• Espionage risk
• Ransomware risk
• Cost To Recovery - $13.7 billion (FY
18)
• Cost Per Incident - $2 million (FY 18)
• Over 10,000+ DoD suppliers

The BPAs will allow ordering activities to:
• Save procurement time
• Reduce contract duplication
• Leverage commercial industry tools
and global database resources
• Realize financial economies of scale
hrough high-volume ordering
• Share critical supply chain risk
information for awareness

This effort is consistent with achieving the goals of Executive Order 13873, Securing the
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Services Supply Chain. The
SCRIPTS BPAs improve how agencies deliver outcomes, provide excellent customer
services, and save taxpayer dollars.
The SCRIPTS BPA Program is built for the present and future to meet the everchanging needs of government users. It is in the Government’s best interest that there
remains an adequate number of BPA Holders eligible to compete for orders and that the
SCRIPTS BPAs provide the most robust representation of supply chain platforms
available in the SCRM illumination tool/platform provider marketplace. Due to the
emerging nature of the marketplace, there may be additional capability advancements
over time, identified by strategic stakeholders, that require additional consideration
following the initial award. The GSA reserves the right to reopen the SCRIPTS BPA
Request for Quote (RFQ) via an amendment to establish additional BPAs.

What do the SCRIPTS BPAs Offer?
The scope of the SCRIPTS BPAs includes multi-component, supply chain risk
illumination tools and professional services to help mitigate our nation’s high and
increasing vulnerability to fraud, abuse, and adversarial exploitation of the supply chain.
The services and subscription-based analytic tools support government agencies at all
levels: U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal, state, local, tribal, and
erritorial government agencies.
The SCRIPTS BPAs provide a total solution for supply chain risk management through
a combination of web-based SCRM tools, integrated platform training, and detailed risk
assessment reports. The web-based tools offer access to data analytics platforms for
efficient risk analysis, identification, reporting, and ongoing monitoring, while the reports
enable agencies to gain deeper insights into specific risks.

Web-Based SCRM Tools
screen for supply chain risks,
vulnerabilities, and compliance
challenges with organized facts
and consistent formats including
ratings to enable quick decision
making with confidence

Risk Assessment Reports
Provide a deeper analysis to
illuminate specific risks

The SCRIPTS BPAs provides streamlined access to widely used marketplace webbased subscription tools and professional services, enabling more efficient information
sharing and collaboration throughout the government. The objective of the SCRIPTS

8

BPAs is to provide full support service offerings with both subscription access to
business intelligence data analytics, which will allow users to run supply chain risk
reports and gain insight through professional data analytics support services. Moreover,
he SCRIPTS BPAs can provide executive summaries, reports, and data visualizations
o enable decision making through the use of recognized platforms such as briefings,
reports, dynamic dashboards, etc.
Usage of the SCRIPTS BPAs provide agencies at-scale data mining and data analytic
capabilities to:
● Increase end-to-end transparency and knowledge of multi-tier supply chain
ecosystem(s)
● Understand the complex connections and dependencies across specific supply
chain ecosystems
● Answer complex risk and resiliency questions impacting suppliers across their
ecosystem.
● Continuously discover and monitor dynamic supply chains to assess indicators of
risks to/from individual suppliers and/or specific parts or products
● Map supply chain ecosystems
● Gain supplier insights
● Understand risk through web-based SCRM tool specific risk scores,
dashboarding capabilities, continuous monitoring, etc.
This suite of SCRIPTS BPAs has a five-year base period and one five-year option
period that may extend the cumulative ordering period to 10 years. Orders can be
awarded under the SCRIPTS BPAs any time prior to the expiration of the ordering
period of the BPA(s). Each order placed against the SCRIPTS BPAs may have differing
periods of performance and option periods.
GSA is responsible for the award, administration, and management of the SCRIPTS
BPAs. Each order placed against the SCRIPTS BPAs will have its own Requiring
Activity (agency requesting services) and an Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) who
will execute the procurement or order.

Who is this guide for?
This guide is written for OCOs and addresses contracting elements unique to the
SCRIPTS BPA. In addition to this guide, OCOs shall follow Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) requirements, their agency policies, and adhere to the terms and
conditions of the SCRIPTS BPA program.

Funds Obligation
No funds are obligated at the SCRIPTS BPA program level. Funds will be obligated on
he orders issued by ordering activities.

Scope
The SCRIPTS BPAs established a governmentwide solution for:
● Multi-component supply chain risk illumination tools, with associated professional
analytic support services, to help mitigate the high vulnerability to fraud, abuse,
and adversarial exploitation of the industrial base supply chain.
● Deployable supply chain illumination capabilities for cyber hygiene; supply chain;
foreign ownership, control, and influence; vendor and affiliated entity vetting; and
vendor personnel vetting that enable the government to be continuously and
dynamically informed on industry supplier health.
● DoD and Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to holistically
screen and vet vendors and underlying supplier networks/affiliated personnel to
ensure suppliers are reputable, in good standing, financially and operationally
secure, and will not introduce unacceptable risk to the government.
● Assessing supplier risk in real time, along with a persistent monitoring capability.
The delivery of these capabilities and associated data analyses are required in
order to provide supplier and network assessment services to DoD and FCEB
agencies that have shared mission areas.
● Fostering a whole of government (WoG) approach to assess risk across the
federal supply chain and to further mitigate vendor threats.
● Providing highly accessible supply chain illumination data and findings within the
DoD and other government agencies based on security classification of analyzed
data for potential use within the spectrum of information security environments
(e.g., Top Secret [TS], Secret, and Controlled Unclassified Information [CUI]
levels).

Benefits
The SCRIPTS BPAs deliver multiple benefits to DoD, federal, state, local, tribal and
erritorial government agencies. These benefits include:
● Cost savings for both the government and BPA Holders due to the reduction in
government and service provider operational overhead (such as the need to
develop, negotiate, monitor, and re-compete contracts), which will result in
streamlined ordering, billing, and distribution processes.
● Volume price discounts off established MAS ceiling prices. These discounted
rates were obtained based on economies of scale and by aggregating the federal
government’s sustained high demand to drive larger volume discounts than
agencies could achieve independently.
● Improved terms and conditions, which further help agencies lower total costs of
ownership.
● More efficient information sharing and collaboration across the whole of
government in accordance with federal law, FASC strategic objectives, and
Executive Orders.

Sharing of Supply Chain Risk Information - WoG Approach
Government agencies are able to share critical Supply Chain Risk information, with
rights to technical data, as outlined in FAR 52.227-14 and DFARS 252.227-7015. This
supports national security objectives. This "buy once, share across Government"
principle applies to vendor risk assessment reports and their derivatives. For example, if
Ordering Agency A (the procuring agency) acquires a license for the BPA Holder’s
SCRM illumination platform and generates an illumination report, Ordering Agency A
can then share this report with Agency B (a non-procuring agency) without Agency B
needing to acquire its own license.
If required by DoD Ordering Activities, the BPA Holder will collaborate with the
government to make datasets broadly available to DoD customers via the DoD
Advanced Analytics (ADVANA) enterprise data catalog. Non-DoD Ordering Activities
using SCRIPTS may request BPA Holders to make data available in their own systems.
These agencies are responsible for detailing the specific technical requirements for how
he BPA Holder's system should integrate with their data storage, management, and
sharing platforms.

18

SCRIPTS BPA Holders
The SCRIPTS suite of BPAs is made of nine separate and distinct BPAs (including one
Contractor Teaming Arrangement (CTA) between two vendors) which allow for small
business set aside and unrestricted procurements in support of agency needs.
The SCRIPTS Small Business Suite awards were awarded as a 100% small business
set aside. Please see the below SCRIPTS Small Business (SB) Suite BPA Holder
Summary.
Note: All BPA holders in the SCRIPTS Small Business Suite are small businesses.

NAICS
The SCRIPTS BPAs contain multiple NAICS codes. Federal Acquisition Regulation
19.102 requires the OCO to determine the appropriate NAICS code and related small
business size standard and include them in all solicitations above the micro-purchase
hreshold. FAR 19.102(b)(1) requires that the NAICS code assigned describes the
principal nature of the product or service being acquired.

20

The FPDS is currently designed to accept only one NAICS code to be associated with a
procurement action. This is simply a limitation of the FPDS and has no bearing on
individual order level NAICS code assignments. For administrative purposes only,
NAICS code 541519 represents the preponderance of the scope of work for the
SCRIPTS BPA Program as a whole. This NAICS is not required to be used at the order
level.
Each SCRIPTS BPA Holder’s primary NAICS code is reflected in the FPDS and
summarized below. Please note that the assignment of the below primary NAICS codes
do not limit BPA Holders’ eligibility to respond to RFQs or limit their ability to perform
work outside of the NAICS assigned as their primary NAICS on their SCRIPTS BPA.

Ordering Procedures
Ordering under these BPAs is decentralized. Ordering activities are to follow the below
ordering procedures in conjunction with their agency’s internal policy and procedures in
preparing orders.

Ordering Paths for the SCRIPTS BPA
## ORDERING PATH

1

Self-Service
→ Ordering agency awards the order for
SCRM Illumination platform access or
SCRM illumination services
→ The ordering agency provides full
acquisition support to award, administer,
and closeout the order
→ The ordering agency is not required to
have a Delegation of Procuremen
Authority (DPA) to place an order under
he SCRIPTS BPA

Non-GSA administered ordering and
administration

ORDERING PATH

2

Full Service
→ GSA awards the order for SCRM
Illumination platform access or SCRM
illumination services on behalf of the
requiring activity
→ GSA provides full acquisition suppor
o award, administer, and closeout the
order for SCRM Illumination platform
access or SCRM illumination services
→ This ordering path requires:
● An Interagency Agreement 7600A
● An Interagency Agreement 7600B
● Military Interdepartmental
Purchase Request (MIPR)/funding

Policy and Regulations
It is the responsibility of the OCO to ensure compliance with all applicable fiscal laws
prior to issuing an order against the SCRIPTS BPAs, and to ensure that the selected
BPA Holder provides the best value for the requirement being ordered.
The SCRIPTS BPAs were competitively awarded by GSA, in accordance with FAR
8.405-3. The FAR provides the primary regulatory guidance for the GSA MAS program.
The General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) is the GSA FAR supplement. The
GSAR provides guidance tailored to GSA acquisitions, including GSA Schedules
contracting. GSAR guidance primarily affects GSA Schedules by providing
supplementary guidance to the Contracting Officers awarding and administering GSA
Schedule contracts.
FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, prescribes procedures that Federal
Government ordering activities must follow when issuing orders against GSA Schedules
including BPAs. Orders placed following these procedures are considered to be
competitive (See FAR Subpart 8.404(a)). FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial
Items, prescribes policies and procedures unique to the acquisition of commercial
items. It implements the Federal Government’s preference for the acquisition of
commercial items contained in Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of
1994 (Public Law 103-355) by establishing acquisition policies more closely resembling
hose of the commercial marketplace and encouraging the acquisition of commercial
items and components. Note: All GSA Schedule contracts are awarded using FAR Par
23

12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.
FAR Subpart 6.102(d)(3), Competition Requirements, pertains to the use of competitive
procedures. It states use of MAS issued under the procedures established by the
Administrator of General Services consistent with the requirement of 41 U.S.C.
259(b)(3)(A) for the MAS program of the General Services Administration is a
competitive procedure.
Any agency utilizing the SCRIPTS BPA must use the procedures described in FAR
Subpart 8.4. Some agencies issue supplementary guidance to the FAR. For example,
he DoD has the DFARS; the Army has the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement (AFARS) in addition to the DFARS; and NASA has the NASA FAR
Supplement (NFS). The competition requirements for civilian agencies and DoD are the
same. The one exception is that DoD requires the Contracting Officer to consider
additional steps when only one response is received to a competitive solicitation over
he simplified acquisition threshold.

Delegation of Procurement Authority
Ordering agencies are not required to have a Delegation of Procurement Authority
(DPA) to place an order under the SCRIPTS BPAs.

Ceiling
The SCRIPTS BPA has no ceiling limitations. Instead, in accordance with FAR Par
8.405-3, an estimated value was established for the SCRIPTS BPA Program.

Acquisition Planning
Orders against the SCRIPTS BPAs are not exempt from acquisition planning. Agencies
must conduct acquisition planning for all acquisitions in accordance with the FAR.
Agency policy dictates whether a formal (written) acquisition plan is needed. Marke
research is required for all acquisitions to promote and provide for the use of
commercial products and services and encourage competition to the maximum exten
practicable (see FAR 7.102). Market research may be conducted using GSA's eLibrary
ool.

Funding
There is no funding at the BPA level. The Government is obligated only to the extent of
orders placed under the established SCRIPTS BPAs. Agencies must identify funding on
individual SCRIPTS BPA orders.

24

Order Level Contract Types
The appropriate order level contract types include:
● Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)
● Time and Materials (T&M)
● Labor Hour (LH)
A firm fixed price pricing arrangement will be utilized for the preponderance of work as
hese types of services are commercially available, the Government has previously
procured these types of services, and the requirements of this procurement are well
defined.
Depending on the pricing model of the BPA Holder, a time and material or labor hour
pricing arrangement may be utilized for the development and production of the SCRM
illumination reports ONLY (labor/professional support services) at the customer's
request.

Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Structure
Each SCRIPTS BPA Holder’s SCRM Illumination tools and reporting solutions differ in
erms of consumption models, pricing models (e.g., the use of a per seat license pricing
model, per user license pricing model, per license pricing model, per report pricing
model, tier volume reporting pricing model, unlimited report pricing model,
customizability, etc.). To allow for meaningful comparisons during quote evaluation,
GSA took a market basket baseline approach where each SCRIPTS BPA Holder has
priced standardized CLINs to capture government needs.
The CLINs established and outlined below do not limit a BPA Holder’s ability to quote
other CLINs and SCRM illumination offerings. BPA order requirements, pricing, and
CLIN structure may be customized to meet each agency’s needs (e.g., number of
users/licenses, number of supplier reports required per 12-month subscription, etc.).
Please note that while each BPA Holder meets the minimum risk indicator illumination
requirements for their respective suite, some BPA Holders exceed the minimum
requirement, providing information on additional risk indicators.

Note: If required by the ordering activity, the BPA Holders must be capable of supporting order
requirements, up to and including Top-Secret/ Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).
If defined by the ordering activity during the RFQ stage of the procurement, the BPA Holder
shall provide the necessary Facility Clearance Level (FCL) documentation (e.g., DD441 or

29

agency equivalent) at the time of quote submission and maintain it in accordance with the
National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) to perform classified work
hroughout the duration of the effort.

Competition Requirements
Below the Micro-Purchase
Threshold

The ordering activity may
place orders at or below
he micro-purchase
hreshold with any
SCRIPTS BPA Holder tha
can meet the agency’s
needs. The ordering
activity should attempt to
distribute any such orders
among the SCRIPTS BPA
holders. See FAR 8.4053(c)(2)(i).

Issuing Requests for Information (RFIs)
GSA’s eBuy platform is ideal for conducting market research. Ordering activities may
use eBuy to issue an RFI to prospective SCRIPTS BPA Holders. This is beneficial as all
BPA Holders meet the minimum risk indicator illumination requirements for their
respective suites, and others exceed the minimum, providing information on additional
risk indicators at no additional cost. Further, market research at the order level can offer
additional visibility into BPA Holders additional priced features and capabilities.

Limiting Competition
As outlined in FAR 8.405-6, orders placed against the SCRIPTS BPAs are exempt from
he requirements in part 6 as they were established under Federal Supply Schedules.
However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration. If the
above competitive procedures are not followed, a Limited Sources Justification must be
prepared and approved documenting the circumstances for restricting competition in
accordance with FAR 8.405-6 for orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold.
Agencies may limit competition for the following three reasons as outlined in
FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)
(A) An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would resul
in unacceptable delays;
(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the
level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly
specialized; or
(C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to
an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was
placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering
procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued
under sole-source or limited-sources procedures.
When a Limited Sources Justification applies, the OCO shall post the RFQ
on eBuy along with the justification or documentation, as required by FAR
8.405-6.

Synopsis Requirements
Generally, orders against the SCRIPTS BPA do not require the OCO to transmit notices
(synopsize) in the Government Point of Entry (GPE) at https://www.sam.gov (see FAR
8.404(a)). The following circumstances require notices (synopsizing) a
https://www.sam.gov:
•

When limiting competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, a notice must be
posted to SAM at https://www.sam.gov within 14 days after placing an order
exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, unless disclosure would
32

compromise national security or create other security risks (see FAR 8.4056(a)(2)(iv))
•

Proposed orders exceeding $25,000 that are funded in whole or in part by the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Pre-Award). See FAR 8.404(g)(1).
Also see FAR 5.704.

•

Orders funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act (Post-Award). See FAR 8.404(g)(1). Also see FAR 5.705.

Responsibility Determination
Responsibility determinations were made by GSA at the BPA level at the time of BPA
award. The OCO can conduct additional responsibility determinations at the order level
in accordance with agency policy.

Pricing
Fair and Reasonable Pricing
Fair and reasonable pricing has been determined at the BPA Level. Ordering activities
may seek additional discounts before placing an order below the simplified acquisition
hreshold. For orders above the simplified acquisition threshold, the ordering activity
shall seek a price reduction in accordance with FAR 8.405-4, price reductions.
Additional order level spot discounts are authorized and encouraged.
Product/Service Availability
Ordering activities can view SCRIPTS BPA Holders catalogs in GSA Advantage by
clicking here.
Step 1: Go to
https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/ws/catalog/strategic_sourcing?group=12

33

Step 2: Click on “Order Products” to view each BPA Holders catalog.

Note: If a BPA Holder’s “Order Products” button is not displayed this means
hey do not have a BPA catalog uploaded to GSA eTools. You can still selec
“Get Quotes” to receive a response to your requirements through GSA eBuy.

Inclusion of Options
Inclusion of options for SCRIPTS BPA orders is allowable. Any order issued (including
its order options) against an existing BPA before the BPA expires will have its own
period of performance (including order options). It shall be completed (including any
order options) according to the Schedule Contract FAR clause 52.216-22(d).
Each BPA Holder’s underlying MAS contract includes the standard FAR clause 52.21622, Indefinite Quantity, to allow ordering activities and MAS contractors to continue
orders up to 60 months after the base MAS contract has expired, including exercising
options. In accordance with the requirements of FAR 17.207, Exercise of Options,
Options may be included on BPA orders, provided that the options are clearly stated in
he requirement and are evaluated as part of the ordering activity’s “best value”
determination.

Clauses and Terms and Conditions
Clauses and terms and conditions are already included in the SCRIPTS BPAs as well
as each BPA Holder’s underlying MAS contract which applies to all orders. All clauses
and terms and conditions of the individual BPA Holder’s awarded GSA MAS contrac
shall apply to the BPAs. To view more on terms and conditions please click here to view
Appendix B - Clauses and Terms and Conditions.

34

Inclusion of Additional Terms and Conditions
Due to the various combinations of provisions/clauses which may be required for an
order based on the contract type, dollar value, and other specific customer agency
requirements, etc., the SCRIPTS BPA Program cannot predetermine all the
provisions/clauses for future individual orders. Ordering agencies may add additional
erms and conditions at the order level. The OCO must include any FAR clauses in full
ext that need to be filled in (for example, FAR 52.217-9 applicable to orders with
options). All terms and conditions of the BPA and the underlying MAS contract will flow
down and apply to all SCRIPTS BPA orders. Note: Ordering activity delivery terms may
extend beyond the BPA delivery terms if included in the ordering activities terms and
conditions.
In the event of a conflict in terms and conditions, the terms and conditions of the BPA
Holder’s MAS contract shall prevail over the BPA and all orders, except to the exten
hat lower prices and delivery terms in the established BPA or orders shall take
precedence over higher prices in the GSA MAS contract.

Security/Facility Clearance
Delivered capabilities facilitate access to informational resources, adhering to the
security classification of analyzed data, enabling potential government use across the
full spectrum of information security environments, encompassing TS/SCI, Secret, and
CUI levels, for both the DoD and other government agencies.
Facility Clearance Level (FCL)
If required by the Ordering Activity, the BPA Holder must be capable of supporting
customer requirements, up to and including Top-Secret/SCI. If defined by the Ordering
Activity during the RFQ stage of the procurement, the quoter shall provide the
necessary FCL documentation (e.g., DD441 or agency equivalent) at the time of quote
submission and maintain it in accordance with the NISPOM to perform classified work
hroughout the duration of the effort. FCL documentation submitted in response to the
order level RFQ to demonstrate support capability will be verified by the Ordering
Activity.
In establishing the SCRIPTS BPAs, the government anticipated that BPA Holders could
be required to access, in support of a customer order requirement, classified
information systems up to and including Secret/Top Secret/TS-SCI. If the BPA Holder
does not possess the appropriate FCL to support this activity, the Ordering Activity may
sponsor the BPA Holder’s request for an FCL, which must be submitted within 60
calendar days of order award (as appropriate based on anticipated need for access to
classified systems). No classified access shall be granted by the Government until the
FCL requirement has been satisfied. NOTE: The SCRIPTS BPA program is not the
sponsoring government agency and will not sponsor facility security clearances.

35

Personnel Clearances
BPA Holders are responsible for providing personnel with appropriate security
clearances to ensure compliance with Government security regulations, as outlined in
he order level RFQ. BPA Holders must fully cooperate with all security checks and
investigations by furnishing requested information to verify the BPA Holder employee's
rustworthiness and suitability for the position. Authorized personnel with data access,
logical access, or physical access to authorized supply chain illumination tool provider
business intelligence database services shall be US citizens, US Nationals, or US
persons. Clearances may require Special Background Investigations (SBI), SCI access,
or Special Access Programs (SAP), or agency-specific access, such as clearance for
restricted data. BPA Holders should refer to order level RFQs for guidance on whether
or not the Ordering Activity will pay for the investigation or if the BPA Holder is
responsible for the cost of the investigation. The SCRIPTS BPA program will no
sponsor personnel clearances.

Cooperative Purchasing
Cooperative purchasing orders for approved state and local Government entities shall
follow all state and local procurement laws.

Inclusion of Non-BPA Items in Orders
Order Level Materials
Order Level Materials (OLM’s) are authorized. OLMs are supplies and/or services
acquired in direct support of an individual order placed against a MAS contract or BPA,
in this case, the SCRIPTS BPAs. OLM pricing is not established or priced at the MAS
contract or BPA level, but at the order level. Since OLMs are identified and acquired a
he order level, the OCO is responsible for making a fair and reasonable price
determination for all OLMs.
OLM procedures may be used to purchase products or services in direct support of
SCRIPTS BPA orders. OLMs include direct materials, subcontracts for supplies and
incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the BPA Holder’s
MAS contract, other direct costs, and indirect costs. OLMs are unpriced. If exercised a
he order level, the amount of the OLM line item cannot exceed 33.33% of the total
order or 33.33% of the BPA.
OLMs are purchased under the authority of the Federal Supply Schedule Program,
pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 152(3), and are not open market items, which are discussed in
FAR 8.402(f). See FAR 8.403(b) and GSAM subpart 538.72 for more details.

36

The goal of allowing OLMs is to:
● Streamline administrative functions by reducing the need for duplicative contrac
actions.
● Reduce or eliminate administrative cost and effort associated with duplicative
contracting actions.
● Reduce overall transaction costs by reducing or eliminating the need for ancillary
contract actions.
● Ultimately allow acquisition professionals to put their focus on where it belongs,
reaching best value and meeting mission requirements.
Rules for usage:
● OLMs cannot be the only item in an order.
● The OLM SIN may not be the primary purpose of the order, but an integral part of
he solution.
● The cumulative value of the OLM SIN shall not exceed 33.33% of the total value
of the order or 33.33% of the BPA.
● The OLM CLIN must be T&M, and it can be the only T&M CLIN on the order.
Note: The OLM CLIN may be added to a Firm Fixed-Price order, however, the
OLM CLIN must be T&M.
● Since OLM CLINs are T&M, a determination and findings (D&F) is required prior
o awarding an order. When the total performance period, including options, is
more than three years, the D&F prepared shall be signed by the OCO and
approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity prior to the execution of the
base period. See FAR 8.404(h) for additional details.
● HCA approval is required when the period of performance, including
options, exceeds three (3) years.
● Except as stated in 552.238-115(d)(10), all terms and conditions that otherwise
apply to the SCRIPTS BPA and its underlying MAS contract also apply to OLMs.
For example, order-level materials must comply with the Trade Agreements Ac

Open Market Items
For administrative convenience, an ordering activity may add items not on the
SCRIPTS BPA (also referred to as open market items) in their order if all
applicable acquisition regulations pertaining to the purchase of the items not on
he Federal Supply Schedule have been followed (e.g., publicizing (FAR Par
5), competition requirements (FAR Part 6), acquisition of commercial products
or commercial services (FAR Part 12), contracting methods (FAR Parts 13, 14,
and 15), and small business programs (Far Part 19)):
● The OCO has determined the price for the item(s) to be fair and
reasonable
● The items are clearly labeled in the order as items not on the SCRIPTS
BPA and Federal Supply Schedule and they conform to the rules for
numbering line items at FAR subpart 4.10
● All clauses applicable to items not on the SCRIPTS BPA and Federal
Supply Schedule are included in the order
Note: Open market items are not OLMs. FAR 8.402(f) must be followed when adding
open-market items to a SCRIPTS BPA order. The procedures for buying open marke
items, as prescribed at FAR 8.402(f), are not applicable to items purchased under OLM
procedures.

Evaluation Factors
Ordering activities must establish evaluation factors at the order level. The procedures
in FAR Subpart 15.3 (Source Selection) do not apply to the SCRIPTS BPA ordering
process. Please see FAR 8.404(a) for further details. The order level RFQ and award
process should be as streamlined as practical to reduce RFQ and quote preparation

energy crises in the international
marketplace. This can occur when
changes in laws or regulations materially
impact a security, business, sector or
market. New laws and regulations
enacted by the government or regulatory
body can increase costs of operating a
business, reduce the attractiveness of
investment, or change the competitive

TECHNOLOGY & CYBER SECURITY

Involves the management of
cybersecurity requirements for
information technology systems, software
and networks, which are driven by
hreats such as cyber-terrorism,
malware, data theft and the advanced
persistent threat (APT). Technology risks
include vulnerabilities and exposures of
systems components and information
systems produced by a specific supplier.
Common risks include weaknesses in
computation logic (code) found in
software and hardware components that,
when exploited, results in a negative
impact to confidentiality, integrity or
availability.

MANUFACTURING & SUPPLY

Occurs when a supplier cannot fulfill the
supply of a product to meet marke
demand. This can be due to reduced
hroughput or production delays caused
by equipment down-time, capacity
constraints, and delays in material
delivery. Additional concerns include
availability of supply, sole-source, and
concentration within a singular country
creating over-reliance.

Occurs when there is a dynamic
disruption within the transportation and
logistics of a product from one point to
another. The transportation industry is
among the most risk-prone of all
industries, due to accidents, losses of
cargo, driver shortages, and deteriorating
infrastructure. These risks can cause
shipment delays, supply chain
disruptions, increased costs, and
damaged reputations. In addition, the
inability to predict and plan for
disruptions in the logistics plan presents
risk in meeting delivery requirements and
TRANSPORTATION & DISTRIBUTION maintaining operations.

PRODUCT QUALITY & DESIGN

Occurs due to inherent design and
quality problems (e.g., raw materials,
ingredients, production, logistics, and
packaging) in which the part does no
meet performance specifications and
quality standards set by industry or DoD.
Includes the detection of a part that was
illegally created and sold under false
pretenses. The part has not faced
industry standard tests during the
production phase (e.g., pressure testing)
o ensure sustainability during usage.
Counterfeit and non-MILSPEC parts
pose significant risk to the function and
safety of the system through malicious
intrusion via backdoor exposures;
increased maintenance costs due to
depreciation in quality; and added
stresses due to the parts inability to
function at true capacity.

operational efficiency, the output to input ratio improves.
Operational risk summarizes the uncertainties and
hazards a company faces when it attempts to do its dayto-day business activities within a given field or industry. A

Solvency, Credit Risk

Solvency is the ability of a company to meet its long-term
debts and financial obligations. Solvency can be an
important measure of financial health, since it's one way of
demonstrating a company's ability to manage its
operations into the foreseeable future. The quickest way to
assess a company's solvency is by checking its
shareholders' equity on the balance sheet, which is the
sum of a company's assets minus liabilities.

OPSEC / INFOSEC
Violation

After vulnerabilities have been determined, the next step is
o determine the threat level associated with each of them.
OPSEC encourages managers to view operations or
projects from the outside in, or from the perspective of
competitors (or enemies) in order to identify weaknesses.
If an organization can easily extract their own information
while acting as an outsider, odds are adversaries outside
