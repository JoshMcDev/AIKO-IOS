Who is this Guide Written for?
This guide is written for warranted Federal Ordering Contracting Officers (OCOs) considering using the
HCaTS contract vehicles. This guide addresses contracting issues and concepts unique to HCaTS
contracts; however, OCOs shall follow FAR regulations and their agency specific policies as well adhere
o the terms of the contract. This ordering guide presumes that OCOs are proficient in their duties, with
a working knowledge of all applicable Federal regulations, executive orders, and human capital and
agency policies.
Additional information to assist customer agencies in using the HCaTS contracts is also available online
at www.gsa.gov/HCaTS. The HCaTS website includes the following resources:

HCaTS Training and Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) process
List of Awarded Contractors

Who Can Use HCaTS?
The HCaTS contracts may be used by all Federal agencies and other entities as listed in the GSA Order,
OGP 4800.2I, Eligibility to use GSA Sources of Supply and Services, as amended.
For purposes of HCaTS Contracts authorized users are identified as OCOs. Only an authorized user, who
is a delegated OCO, may solicit, award, and administer a task order under HCaTS Contracts. In order to
qualify as an authorized user, a duly warranted Contracting Officer of the Federal Government, as
defined in FAR Subpart 2.101, in good standing, must have received a Delegation of Procuremen
Authority (DPA) from the HCaTS PMO.
Contractor employees authorized under FAR 51.1 Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources to use
HCaTS are considered OCOs and are not required to obtain a DPA as their authority is granted to them
by a Federal Government Contracting Officer administering an applicable contract (e.g.,a FFRDC).

How to Begin Using HCaTS?
In order to solicit and place a task order under HCaTS, the OCO must first obtain a Delegation of
Procurement Authority (DPA) from the HCaTS Contracting Officer. In order to do this, you must:



Be a warranted Federal Contracting Officer (CO) in good standing
Formally apply for and receive DPA training

How to Request DPA Training?
4 of 14

DPA Training is approximately 60 minutes long and is provided through an online meeting space, or in
person. To request DPA training, visit HCaTS.gsa.gov. For an on-site training, email us a
HCaTStraining@gsa.gov.

Roles and Responsibilities
DPAs are issued to individual contracting officers, not agencies at large. There is no limit to the number
of DPAs that can be issued to Contracting Officers within an Agency. An OCO with a DPA has the
authority to solicit, award, administer, and modify task orders against the HCaTS Contracts.
The OCO shall comply with the HCaTS master contract terms and conditions, the Ordering Guide, the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and authorized agency supplement or exception, applicable
agency-specific statutes and policies, and the additional responsibilities defined in the HCaTS DPA
certification.
OCO duties include, but are not limited to:


Task order scope compliance with HCaTS



Certify funds availability and allocate funds for requirements



Process disputes, claims, or protests under HCaTS



Request and receive a DPA prior to soliciting and awarding a task order under HCaTS



Comply with the terms and conditions of the HCaTS contracts



Comply with the ordering procedures outlined in FAR Subpart 16.505 and other agency specific
regulatory supplements



Issue task order solicitations under the proper HCaTS MA-IDIQ contract numbers



Comply with Inherently Governmental Functions policy as outlined in FAR 7.503



Allow a reasonable time for fair opportunity proposal submission



Resolve any performance issues, disputes, claims or protests at the task order level



Respond to all Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests at the task order level



Enter task order performance evaluation in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting
System (CPARS) or alternative past performance assessment reporting system mandated by
customer agencies that do not require the use of CPARS



Close out task orders in a timely manner

Rights Reserved by the Procuring Contracting Officer
The HCaTS CO is the sole and exclusive GSA Government official with actual authority to administer and
modify the HCaTS contracts terms and conditions, monitor contractor performance in the areas of
contract compliance and contract administration, and assist the contractor and OCO on matters related
o the HCaTS terms and conditions.
5 of 14

The OCO for each task order may designate a Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to perform
specific administrative or technical functions. The specific rights and responsibilities of the COR for each
ask order shall be described in writing, which upon request, shall be provided to the contractor. A COR
has no actual, apparent, or implied authority to bind the Government. OCOs may not transfer delegation
of procurement authority to a non-delegated Contracting Officer.

What are some of the benefits of using HCaTS?
HCaTS is flexible, easy to use, and allows agencies to:


Allows for all contract types at the task order level: Fixed-Price (all types), Cost-Type, Time-andMaterials, and Labor-Hour, including hybrid mixtures of contract types



Utilize incentives, performance based measures



Establish a CLIN structure tailored to individual task order requirements



Help in achieving agency small business and socioeconomic goals



Small business subcontracting plans have already been incorporated and administered by the
HCaTS PMO office for other than small businesses



Include Other Direct Costs (ODCs) and Ancillary Support at the task order level as needed



Access templates and sample acquisition documents



Acknowledge that responsibility determinations have already been completed for all contract
holders in accordance with FAR Part 9, at the master contract level



Share lessons-learned and best practices

Options for Accessing the HCaTS Contracts
Agencies can use HCaTS in two ways:
1. Direct Buy: Agencies with designated OCOs may issue orders directly against HCaTS; the only
requirement is that the OCOs obtain a DPA certificate prior to using the HCaTS. The buying
activity is responsible to conduct all the acquisition actions, from acquisition planning to task
order completion and close out. If you consider using HCaTS via Direct-Buy, see the section
“How to Begin Using HCaTS”.
2. Assisted Acquisition Service (AAS): Agencies may enter into a Memorandum of Agreemen
(MOA) with GSA to issue a task order. MOA’s can be for cradle-to-grave services. GSA has
specific statutory authority under 40 U.S.C 501 to purchase supplies and non-personal services
on behalf of other agencies. Therefore, the Economy Act does not apply to HCaTS orders.
Additionally, AAS offers value-added, customized, acquisition, project management, and

6 of 14

financial management services for large and/or complex solutions. To learn more about AAS,
visit www.gsa.gov/r2assistedacquisition.

HCaTS Program Background
The General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) formed a
partnership to jointly award and administer a strategically sourced contract vehicle for human capital
and training solutions. Through this partnership, GSA is principally responsible for contrac
administration, while OPM is responsible for policy oversight.
HCaTS provides a common architecture and platform across the Federal Government for the acquisition
of complex human capital and training requirements. The HCaTS Program Contracts are intended to
provide human capital and training solutions through the effort of bona fide executive, administrative,
and professional employees as defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

Scope of HCaTS
HCaTS and HCaTS Small Business (HCaTS SB) contracts refer to the master contracts of which the
applicable terms, conditions, and clauses flow down to all HCaTS task orders. The services covered
under the HCaTS Program can span across three Key Service Areas (KSAs):
KSA 1: Customized Training and Development Services
KSA 2: Customized Human Capital Strategy Services
KSA 3: Customized Organizational Performance Improvemen
Additionally, the scope allows for ancillary services and costs necessary to complete a total solution
procurement. Services under the HCaTS Program may be commercial and/or non-commercial, classified
and non-classified, CONUS and OCONUS. All HCaTS Task Orders must be within the scope of one or
more of HCaTS’ KSAs. Review Section C of the HCaTS Program Contracts for a complete description of
he scope.

Out of Scope Services
The following requirements are prohibited under HCaTS scope:
•

Inherently Governmental Functions – See FAR Subpart 7.5 and Office of Federal
Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 11-01

•

Personal services contracts – FAR Paragraph 37.104(a)

•

Architectural & Engineering (A&E) Services subject to the Brooks Act and FAR Part 36
acquisition procedures

7 of 14

•

A requirement that primarily uses employees not employed in a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional capacity as defined in 29 CFR Part 541 and/or employees
primarily employed as laborers or mechanics – FAR Section 22.401

•

Requirements where the primary purpose is the development of information technology as
defined by FAR Section 2.101 and HCaTS Program Contracts Section C.3.3

•

Requirements where the primary purpose is temporary services as defined by FAR Section
37.112 and HCaTS Program Contracts Section C.3.4.

HCaTS Vehicles/Pools/NAICS
HCaTS is comprised of two major vehicles and one sub-vehicle:
1. HCaTS Unrestricted (HCaTS-U)
2.a HCaTS Small Business (HCaTS SB)
2.b HCaTS 8(a)
Each of the vehicles are consists of two Pools covering different NAICS codes and size standards. All
NAICS codes in each Pool have the same Small Business Size Standard. Some contractors won contracts
in more than one Pool/SubPool and were awarded separate contracts for each of them. The curren
HCaTS Pools are as follows:
Pool 1 – Size Standard $12M
611430, Professional and Management Development Training (Primary NAICS)
611699, All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction
624310, Vocational Rehabilitation Services
Pool 2 – Size Standard $16.5M Size Standard
541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services
541612, Human Resources Consulting Services (Primary NAICS)
541613, Marketing Consulting Services
541618, Other Management Consulting Services
611710, Educational Support Services

HCaTS Contractors:
The list of HCaTS contract holders and their socio-economic status under each vehicle and pool is
available on:

The Ordering Process
HCaTS is a Multi-award IDIQ contract; when using HCaTS, OCOs must follow FAR Subpart 16.5 for
ordering processes. Additionally, OCOs shall follow FAR Subpart 16.3 and FAR Parts 30 and 31 for costreimbursement task orders unless an authorized exception applies. Fair opportunity procedures in
accordance with FAR Paragraph 16.505(b)(1) prescribed for the dollar value of the task order must be
used. When the OCO plans to award a task order based on an exception to fair opportunity, applicable
justifications and approvals in accordance with FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2) must be prepared and
obtained.

Step 1: Acquisition Planning
Orders against MA-IDIQ contracts, such as HCaTS, are not exempt from Acquisition Planning as
prescribed in FAR Part 7. Conduct market research for your requirement in accordance with regulations
as you would do with any procurement. You are encouraged to issue Requests for Information (RFI),
draft solicitations, and other documents to HCaTS contract holders as part of your market research
efforts.
Generally, OCOs shall follow the ordering procedures in FAR Subpart 16.505. Unless an authorized
exception applies, fair opportunity procedures prescribed for the dollar value of the task order must be
used. When the OCO plans to award an order based on an exception to fair opportunity, applicable
Justifications and Approvals should be prepared as part of the planning process. Any required notices
and postings must also be issued.

Which HCaTS Vehicle to Use: HCaTS Unrestricted or HCaTS SB or HcaTS
8(a)?
Which HCaTS vehicle you will use depends on the determination made in the acquisition planning
process as to whether or not your requirement should be set-aside for small business. Agencies have
differing standards, interpretations, and policies regarding set-aside determinations. GSA encourages
he practice of considering the small business awardees to fill your requirement first. The determination
o set-aside a procurement for small business or not is part of the acquisition planning process and to be
done prior to contract type selection. The HCaTS program office offer no opinion on any agency’s
decision making process concerning this issue.
When a small business set-aside is to be accomplished, use HCaTS SB as these contracts are awarded
exclusively to small businesses. When a small business set-aside will not be accomplished and Full and
Open is appropriate, use HCaTS Unrestricted.

 For 100% small business set-aside -> Must use HCaTS SB
 For WOSB/EDWOSB/VOSB/SDVOSB/HubZone Set-Aside -> Must use HCaTS SB
 For 8(a) Direct/Competitive Set-Aside -> Must use HCaTS 8(a)
9 of 14

 For Full and Open -> Must use HCaTS U

Set-Asides for Socioeconomic Competition under HCaTS SB
HCaTS Small Business (SB) is a total small business set-aside contract. All orders issued under HCaTS SB
are automatically considered set-aside for small business as only small businesses were awarded an
HCaTS SB contract.
Unless the order solicitation explicitly requires size/socioeconomic recertification at the order level, the
OCO shall rely on the size/socioeconomic status shown in the HCaTS SB Contractor List available here:
www.gsa.gov/HCaTS. All HCaTS SB Contractors’ size/socioeconomic status remains unchanged for each
of their HCaTS SB contracts unless modified by a FAR 52.219-28 re-representation or due to a novation,
merger, or acquisition IAW HCaTS Contracts Section G.3.10.
The OCO has discretionary authority under FAR 19.502-4(c) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(F) to further set-aside
orders for any of the small business concerns identified in FAR 19.000(a)(3) when it is anticipated tha
quotes will be obtained from at least two eligible small business concerns for which the order is to be
set-aside.
-

HUBZone Small Business concerns
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns
* Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) concerns
* Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns

* EDWOSB and WOSB competitive set-asides are subject to specific NAICS industry groups in which
EDWOSBs and WOSBs are underrepresented. The eligible NAICS Codes for EDWOSB and WOSB setasides are subject to change by the SBA. See sba.gov/wosb for the updated list of NAICS Codes to
determine HCaTS SB Pool NAICS availability for EDWOSB or WOSB set-asides.
Small businesses retain their small business size status and socio-economic status during the ordering
period under HCaTS SB. Accordingly, OCOs should not use SAM to determine the size status applicable
o an HCaTS SB vendor. For HCaTS contractors, OCOs should use the spreadsheet found a
gsa.gov/hcats under “Who is on HCaTS” in order to determine the socioeconomic status of companies.
When setting aside orders for socio-economic concerns, the specific small business program eligibility
requirements identified in FAR Part 19 apply.

Special Instructions Regarding Orders Set-Aside for 8(a)
Ordering activities seeking to satisfy their requirements through either 8(a) competitive or 8(a) Sole
Source (Direct) task orders must use the HCaTS 8(a) vehicle only. OCOs cannot utilize HCaTS SB Pools or
HCaTS U Pools for this purpose.

Competitive 8(a) Orders


Follow similar procedures to competing orders under any other HCaTS Pool.

10 of 14








HCaTS 8(a) Pools were set aside exclusively for 8(a) competition, so if an OCO wishes to utilize a
competitive 8(a) set aside task order, they would simply follow the fair opportunity procedures
for soliciting to that HCaTS 8(a) Pools.
May compete at any dollar level above the minimum SAT ($250,000).
All 8(a) Pool awardees have been offered and accepted by SBA into the 8(a) program at the IDIQ
Contract Level under SBA requirement number TX1565638190Y.
No need to offer the order for SBA acceptance to get 8(a) credit for the order.
All competitive orders default to the size/status shown in HCaTS 8(a) Pools notwithstanding
heir size/status shown in any other system.

Sole Source (Direct) 8(a) Orders










Sole Source (Direct) 8(a) Orders may be issued at the OCO’s discretion subject to SBA approval.
Sole Source (Direct) 8(a) orders must each be offered to and accepted by SBA before award. In
he offer letter to SBA refer to HCaTS SBA requirement #TX1565638190Y.
A firm must be a current 8(a)
participant at the time of task order award in order to receive a Sole Source (Direct) order. The
OCO should check the 8(a) status at SBA Dynamic Search https://web.sba.gov/pronet/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm before considering a Sole Source (Direct) order.
Contractors who have exited from the 8(a) program are ineligible to receive an 8(a) Sole Source
(Direct) order award.
Follow your agencies’ partnership agreement for offering the Sole Source (Direct) order to SBA:
https://www.sba.gov/document/support--sba-and-agencies-partnership- agreements.
In accordance with FAR 19.805-1(a)(2) the current 8(a) Sole Source (Direct) order limit is $4.5
million; Except for 8(a) concerns owned by an Indian Tribe (Tribal Owned) or an Alaska Native
Corporation (ANC) (reference FAR 19.805- 1(b)(2)) which have a Sole Source(Direct) order limi
of $25 million in accordance with FAR 19.808-1.
Department of Defense (DoD) only: DoD may also issue Sole Source (Direct) orders to 8(a)
Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) (reference 13 CFR 124.506(b)(2))
DFARS 219.808-1 increases Sole Source (Direct) order limit to $100 million for ANC/Tribal
Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns.

Sole Source (Direct ) 8(a) orders to ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns




Notwithstanding HCaTS 8(a) Pools IDIQ contracts were awarded competitively, 13 CFR 124.506
(b)(1) and (2)’s “...if SBA has not accepted the requirement into the 8(a) BD program as a
competitive procurement…” only applies to an order level requirement and may not be used as a
rationale to prohibit allowing orders to ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concerns on a Sole Source (Direct)
order basis above the FAR 19.805-1(a)(2) $4.5 million threshold.
HCaTS 8(a) Pools order requirement that was initially solicited on a competitive basis may not be
removed from competition and subsequently awarded to an ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concern on a
Sole Source (Direct) order basis.

Task Order Contract Types
Subject to FAR and agency level required consideration criteria, limitations, and/or prohibitions, you
may use any appropriate contract type(s) including:
11 of 14







Fixed-Price, all types
Cost-Type
Time-and-Materials
Labor-Hour
Hybrid of any of these types

If you elect to use a hybrid of contract types, please use a separate line item number for the work under
each contract type and annotate each line item with the associated contract type. This is important for
clause implementation.

Assign a NAICS Code to Each Order
The OCO may use the IDIQ Contract primary NAICS at the task order level or select a more specific NAICS
depending on the requirement. The chart below identifies the HCaTS NAICS codes for both Pools with
he primary NAICS code for each Pool appearing in bold type font:

Task Order Funding and Funding Limitations
All task orders must be funded by the agency with the requirement. However, task orders placed under
he HCaTS Program may not be used to circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of
funds (FAR Paragraph 16.505(a)(8)(ii)).

Minimum and Maximum Order Limitations
2 of 14

The minimum per-order limitation on HCaTS contracts is at the micro-purchase threshold as defined by
FAR Subpart 2.101. The Government is not obligated to purchase and the contractor is not required to
furnish services valued at less than the micro-purchase threshold. The maximum dollar amount for
HCaTS contracts, including all options, if exercised, is $3.45 billion for Pool 1 and $2.3 billion for Pool 2.

Task Order Size Representation
The HCaTS PMO maintains a list on the HCaTS website that provides the business size classification for
each contractor as it pertains to their HCaTS contract.

Task Order Duration
The period of performance for each task order awarded under an HCaTS contract shall be specified in
he task order in accordance with FAR Paragraph 16.505(c). Task orders shall be solicited and awarded
prior to the expiration of the HCaTS contracts’ ordering periods and may extend (including option
periods) up to 5-years and 6-months beyond the ordering period (if FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to
Extend Services is included in the task order). After the HCaTS contracts expire, they will remain active
for administration purposes only.

Task Order Small Business Size Representation
The HCaTS PMO maintains the list of contractors on the HCaTS PMO website that provides the Small
Business Size Standards and socio-economic categories for each contractor as it pertains to its HCaTS
contract.

Labor Categories for Task Order Work
The list of HCaTS Labor Categories and Definitions is found in Attachment J.1, HCaTS Standardized Labor
Categories (LCAT). Each Labor Category identifies the specific Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)
occupations mapped to that Labor Category. Except for ancillary labor as defined under HCaTS Program
Contracts Section B.3, when responding to a request for proposal under task order solicitations,
regardless of contract type, the Contractor shall identify the LCATs and corresponding SOC System
Number. The Contractor may deviate from the requirements listed below, however the contractor mus
clearly identify the deviation in its proposal; additionally OCOs must document and make a proper
adjustment in a follow-on fair and reasonable price determination and other documents as necessary.
The following qualification substitution chart from the HCaTS contracts Section B.2.1 applies:

Degree

Experience Substitution

Degree and Experience Substitution

Bachelor’s Degree

Six years of relevant work

Associate’s Degree plus four years of relevant
work experience

Master’s Degree

work experience

3 of 14

Doctorate Degree

20 years of relevant work
Bachelor’s Degree plus 16 years or a Master’s
experience
Degree plus 12 years of relevant work experience

OCOs shall evaluate any identified deviations from the HCaTS definitions of Junior, Journeyman, Senior,
and Subject Matter Expert (SME). As part of that evaluation, the OCO should consider any potential
impacts on the agency’s requirements in terms of performance and price and document the rationale
for acceptance of any proposed deviation.
The OCO shall identify each ancillary support service and ODC by a separate CLIN on the task order
award as described below. The task order solicitation should provide instructions to Offerors on how to
identify and call attention to the intent to use ancillary professional labor. The proposal should include,
at a minimum:








The proposed labor category title
Expertise and qualifications required by the specialized labor category
Duties to be performed by the specialized labor
Segment of the statement of work that the specialized labor will perform with references to
statement of work sections
An explanation of why the specialized labor is required with a discussion of which HCaTS
LCATs in HCaTS Program Contract Section J.1 (Standardized Labor Categories) were
considered and why they were not appropriate or did not fit the task order requirements
A discussion of the BLS SOC occupations that were examined to determine if the specialized
labor could be mapped to a BLS SOC occupation as applicable

NOTE: If the agency determines during requirements development that specialized professional labor
would be required to support segments of the task order work, it should be stated in the task order
solicitation and should, at a minimum, include the elements discussed above. This ensures that all
Offerors use the same vocabulary and can easily be compared with one another.
Important NOTE: Contractors may deviate from the definitions above when responding to task order
solicitations so long as the deviations are clearly identified in their task order proposal. For example, a
Contractor might label an employee as “Senior”, but the employee does not have a college degree.
Likewise, a Contractor might label an employee as “SME” even though the employee has less than 2
years of experience. Deviations shall be clearly identified and properly priced in proposals submitted in
response to task order solicitations.

Other Direct Costs (ODC) and Ancillary Support
ODC support, integral and necessary as part of a total integrated solution within the scope of HCaTS for
which there is not a labor category specified in the Attachment J.1 or includes other direct costs such as
ravel, materials, equipment, subcontractors, etc., to obtain a total service solution, are allowable costs
and may be included within an individual task order under HCaTS. The Contractor should propose and
identify each other direct cost separately and the OCO should identify each ODC support service or
other direct cost by a separate CLIN in the task order award. Agencies should follow agency specific

4 of 14

policies as well as FAR Subpart 16.505 and FAR Part 6 regarding competition requirements as it relates
o ODCs.

Security Clearance Considerations for Classified Orders
The task order solicitation should clearly express all requirements for security clearances, both facility
and personnel. All classified handling procedures shall be adhered to at all times.

Labor on T&M and L-H Task Orders
The Contractor may provide separate and/or blended loaded hourly labor rates for prime Contractor
labor, each Subcontractor, and each Division, Subsidiary, or Affiliate in accordance with the provisions
set forth in FAR 52.216-29, FAR 52.216-30, or FAR 52.216-31. The OCO must identify which provision is
applicable in the task order solicitation and Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). T&M and L-H task orders
require the HCaTS Standardized Labor Categories and their associated rates to be identified in the task
order award document. ODC subcontract labor shall be proposed and awarded as Materials in
accordance with FAR 52.232-7, Payments under T&M and L-H contracts.
When preparing solicitations for T&M and L-H task order line items, in the task order solicitation, the
OCO must include the provision FAR 52.216-31 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements-Commercial Item Acquisition.
For organizations within DoD, when selecting FAR 52.216-29, the OCO must also select the appropriate
DFAR clause (such as 252.216-7002, Alternate A). OCOs shall always follow their agency’s internal
guidelines including required justifications and/or approvals for use of this contract type.
NOTE: Only for Sole-source T&M and L-H task orders, the pricing associated with the HCaTS Labor
Categories can be used as a ceiling price point. Request the pricing from HCaTS PMO office for your
sole-source T&M, L-H task order. The pricing is fully burdened, and has ceiling rates that do not change
with the delivery location for exempt (professional) labor categories. Contractors may offer pricing tha
is lower than the ceiling rates at the task order level.

Service Category Labor Standards (SCLS)
The HCaTS labor categories are subject to the Service Category Labor Standards (SCLS) (formerly known
as Service Contract Act/SCA) in accordance with FAR Subpart 22.10 and other applicable agency specific
regulatory supplements. The OCO must identify such work in the task order solicitation and make a
determination as to whether the SCLS wage determinations are to be applied or not. HCaTS includes
clauses applicable to any SCLS work that is within the scope of HCaTS.

FAR Clause 52.204-14, Service Contract Reporting Requirements
The OCO shall insert the clause at 52.204-14, Service Contract Reporting Requirements, in solicitations
and contracts for services (including construction) that meet or exceed the thresholds at 4.1703. This
5 of 14

clause is not required for actions entirely funded by DoD, contracts awarded with a generic entity
identifier, or in classified solicitations, contracts, or orders.
For task orders subject to the Service Contract Reporting Requirements, contractors must provide
information on the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) employee hours invoiced against the contract by the
prime contractor and any subcontractors. In addition, OCOs must keep the track of the annual
reporting; follow up with delinquent contractors regarding their obligation to report, and exercise
appropriate contractual remedies.

Rights in Data
The following Rights in Data Clauses are incorporated into HCaTS Program Contracts: FAR Clause 52.22714 Rights in Data—General and FAR Clause 52.227-17 Rights in Data—Special Works. The OCO should
ensure that the applicable Rights in Data clause(s) is (are) clearly assigned in each task order solicitation
and resulting task order.

Contract Access Fee (CAF)
The HCaTS CAF shall be included in each task order under a separate and distinct line item for the base
year and each option period (if applicable). In response to all task order solicitations, regardless of
contract type, the Contractor shall always propose a CAF rate of 0.75% of the total contract value,
including ODCs, travel, options, etc.
The CAF is to be included on each invoice as 0.75% of the total invoiced charges. The CAF will be paid by
he customer agency to the Contractor. The Contractor will report and submit (quarterly) the collected
CAF to GSA.
NOTES: For task orders awarded before 1 August 2018; the CAF remain as a 2% fixed fee; however,
OCOs must change the CAF from 2% to 0.75% at the time of the next option year that will be exercised
on or after 1 August 2018. If an option to the task order will not be exercised on or after 1 August 2018,
he CAF remain as 2% until the completion of the current base year or option year.
Visit our website for CAF updates, exceptions, or agency specific CAF agreements, if any.

Other Significant Planning Considerations
Other key considerations to address in developing your acquisition plan and preparing for task order
solicitation include:






Economy Act - does not apply to HCaTS task orders; GSA is specifically authorized by law to
purchase supplies or non-personal service on behalf of other agencies. No documentation is
required unless mandated by your agency’s policy.
Inherently Governmental Functions - FAR 7.503(e) stipulates that the requirements official
shall provide to the OCO, concurrent with the statement of work, a written determination
hat none of the functions to be performed are Inherently Governmental.
Personal Services - FAR 37.104 characterizes personal services contracts as an employeeemployer relationship between the Government and contractor’s personnel. The



Government is normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under competitive
appointment or other procedures required by civil service laws. Obtaining personal services
by contract, rather by direct hire, circumvents those laws unless Congress has specifically
authorized acquisition of the services by contract. Personal services are NOT authorized on
HCaTS.
Performance-based contracting methods are preferred
Identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest (COI).
Preparation of a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan and identification of performance
metrics, as applicable.
Tailor the Evaluation Factors and Source Selection Methodology as applicable to your
requiremen

HCaTS Tools and Planning Resources
As an authorized user of HCaTS, agencies have access to a number of tools and resources found in the
HCaTS Resource Directory which can be accessed through www.gsa.gov/hcats. These resources are
constantly being edited, changed and updated to better assist agencies with their requirements.

Scope Determination:
If you are not sure whether HCaTS can support your requirement:
The HCaTS PMO offers a complementary scope review; submit your request through gsa.gov/hcats,
under “Pre-Award Scope Review”. GSA offers and strongly encourages OCOs to take advantage of task
order pre-solicitation scope reviews. This review will ensure your requirement is being placed under the
appropriate contract vehicle and pool.




Issue a Request for Information (RFI) under the HCaTS vehicles. Download the HCaTS RFI
emplate from gsa.gov/hcats under “Resource Directory”. The process of issuing the RFI is
similar to issuing an RFP; refer to the ordering process, Step 3: Issue a Solicitation.
Review HCaTS contractors Capabilities Statements available on gsa.gov/hcats under “Who is on
HCaTS”.

Step 2: Define the Requirements
Requirements Development Support Resources
Agencies have access to a considerable array of support resources during the requirements
development phase. GSA’s AAS may be available to support your agency in task order solicitation,
including defining your requirements and developing the solicitation package.

Price Estimating and Developing IGCE
GSA has developed a number of automated pricing tools to assist in developing various programs task
order IGCEs, below are a few examples:
7 of 14

 Discovery Tool (https://discovery.gsa.gov/): information on all HCaTS contract holders
and streamlines the process for developing acquisition planning.
 Contract Awarded Labor Categories (CALC) Tool (https://calc.gsa.gov/): helps find
awarded prices to use in negotiations for labor contracts. It offers ceiling prices, fully
burdened costs, services data, and worldwide rates.
 OASIS Price Estimating Tool (PET) (https://oasispet.gsa.gov/): assists in the
development of the labor portion of the IGCE. Its power lies in the ability to index
pricing to approximately 640 precise geographic locations. It was originally developed
for other program (OASIS) at GSA, but HCaTS labor categories are available there as
well.

Developing the Solicitation
Use the solicitation form and format for task orders normally prescribed and used by your agency for
ask order solicitations, consistent with FAR 16.505 procedures. In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii)
Fair Opportunity, “the contracting officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum.” FAR
16.505(b)(1) states that the contracting officer must: (A) Develop placement procedures that will
provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order and reflect the requiremen
and other aspects of the contracting environment; (B) Not use any method (such as allocation or
designation of any preferred awardee) that would not result in a fair consideration being given to all
awardees prior to placing each order; (C) Tailor the procedures to each acquisition; (D) Include the
procedures in the solicitation and the contract; and (E) Consider price or cost under each order as one of
he factors in the selection decision. FAR 16.505(b)(1) also provides additional Fair Opportunity
requirements for different dollar thresholds. Please be sure to reference the FAR during solicitation
development.
In addition to the typical content of your solicitation, certain information particular to using HCaTS
appropriately should be added, emphasized, or highlighted in your solicitation. That information will be
discussed and explained in the succeeding paragraphs. A Task Order Solicitation Template (optional) and
additional samples are available on gsa.gov/hcats under “Resource Directory”.
In addition to the information required by FAR 16.505(a)(7), all task order solicitations shall provide the
following information at a minimum:








Applicable NAICS, Product Service Code (PSC), and Service Category(ies) covered
SOW/PWS/SOO
Contract Line Item Number Information and Contract Type(s)
Evaluation Factors and Source Selection Methodology
Period of Performance and Place of Performance
Proposal Due Date and Submittal Instructions
Other Pertinent Information (for example: agency specific clauses, optional clauses, etc.)

Clauses and Provisions
8 of 14

All applicable and required provisions/clauses set forth in FAR 52.301 automatically flow down to all
HCaTS task orders, based on their specific contract type, statement of work, and dollar value. All
applicable and required provisions/clauses that automatically flow down to task orders shall remain
unchanged throughout the entire period of performance under HCaTS. If future applicable or required
provision/clause are to the benefit of future task orders solicited under HCaTS, the future applicable or
required provision/clause may be updated by FAC No. and effective date under a bilateral modification
o the HCaTS contracts.
In accordance with FAR 8.005, the OCO shall, “Insert the clause at 52.208-9, Contractor Use of
Mandatory Sources of Supply and Services, in solicitations and contracts that require a contractor to
provide supplies or services for Government use that are on the Procurement List maintained by the
Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.” For certain task orders
where supplies are anticipated to be supplied for use by the Government, the Procurement Lis
maintained by the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is a
mandatory source of supply and should be checked to see if these supplies are available from this
source.
The OCO may identify any optional and/or agency-specific provisions/clauses for each individual task
order solicitation and subsequent award. The OCO must provide the provision/clause Number, Title,
Date, and fill-in information (if any), as of the date the task order solicitation is issued.

Evaluation Factors
In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii), the policies in FAR Subpart 15.3 (Source Selection) DO NOT
apply to the MA-IDIQ ordering process. In addition, “The contracting officer may exercise broad
discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures. The contracting officer should keep
submission requirements to a minimum. Contracting officers may use streamlined procedures, including
oral presentations.”
The task order solicitation and award process should be as streamlined as practical to reduce solicitation
and proposal preparation costs and time for both the Government and the Contractor, respectively.

Step 3: Issue the Solicitation
Methods of Issuing the Task Order Solicitation
A Task Order Solicitation under HCaTS may be issued by:

Method #1: Emailing an RFP directly to all contractor*(preferred method)
The following Pool Links generate a group email to the official points of contact for all prime contrac
holders in the respective pool.

9 of 14

The primary purpose of the Pool Links is for authorized Government officials (customers) to issue
Requests for Proposals (RFPs), Requests for Information (RFIs), Sources Sought Notices (SSNs), or other
Market Research requests as an alternative to using GSA eBuy.
Important: Each pool is a separate Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). When issuing an RFP,
only one contract vehicle (HCaTS U, HCaTS SB, or HCaTS 8(a)) and one pool (1 or 2) can be solicited.

*For any Sole Source type task orders, contact the prospective contractor individually using the contact
information from the contractor lists file available for download on HCaTS Website (gsa.gov/hcats).

Method #2: Posting an RFP on GSA’s e-Buy at http://www.ebuy.gsa.gov
The task order RFP must be sent to all Contractors within a given Pool. In accordance with FAR
16.505(b)(1)(i) Fair Opportunity, “The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity
o be considered for each order exceeding $3,500 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts or
multiple task-order contracts, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2).”
For a sole source or direct award, FAR Paragraph 16.505(b)(1) applies for the fair opportunity
notification requirement.
Important Note: OCOs may not issue a RFP or RFI under more than one vehicle and one pool at a time.

Contractors in Dormant Status
HCaTS contractors may be placed in Dormant Status while they develop corrective measures for the
HCaTS Program CO to review and approve as defined under HCaTS Program Contracts Section H.25.
During dormancy, Contractors may continue to work on existing task order awards, but are prohibited
from competing for new task order awards. GSA will maintain a list of Contractors in Dormant Status.
Prior to award, OCOs must check the contractor list located on gsa.gov/hcats to verify the dormancy
status of the potential awardee.

Step 4: Evaluate Proposals
OCOs should evaluate proposals based on the methodology stated in the task order solicitation to
maintain fairness in the ordering process and mitigate protest risk.
10 of 14

Price Fair and Reasonable Determination
The OCO is responsible for analyzing order proposals and documenting the price evaluation to include a
determination that the final agreed to price is fair and reasonable. Generally, no additional pricing data
from the Offeror will be needed if there is adequate price competition in accordance with FAR Section
15.402.
OCOs are encouraged to negotiate additional discounts off of the awarded rates (FAR Subpart 15.3 does
not apply!).
NOTE: All costs associated with the preparation, presentation, and discussion of the Contractor’s
proposal in response to a task order solicitation will be at the Contractor’s sole and exclusive expense.
Vendors shall not seek reimbursement for proposal preparation costs at the task order level.

Step 5: Award the Task Order
Order Award Documentation
Document your task order awards in accordance with regulation and local policy.

GSA Task Order Award and Modification Information
The OCO is encouraged to submit all task order award and modification data within 30 calendar days to
he HCaTS Program Office at hcats@gsa.gov for orders awarded under Unrestricted contracts or
sbhcats@gsa.gov related to Small Business contracts.

Public Notice of Awards Not Providing for Fair Opportunity
For orders based on an exception to fair opportunity, the OCO must post the required public notice in
accordance with the procedures found at FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D). Note the actions excluded from this
requirement are disclosures that would compromise national security and small business set-asides
authorized by FAR Paragraph 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).

Order Level Protests
The OCO is encouraged to contact the HCaTS PMO for any HCaTS related assistance including assistance
with disputes, claims, or protests. However, the OCO is responsible for resolving any performance
issues, disputes, claims, or protests at the task order level. FAR Paragraph 16.505(a)(10) prohibits
protests under FAR subpart 33.1 in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of task orders
against an MA-IDIQ contract except for:



A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period of performance, or
maximum value of the contrac
A protest on orders valued in excess of $10 million.

11 of 14

FAR 16.505(a)(10)(i)(B) grants sole authority to hear protests of orders in excess of $10 million and filed
in accordance with the procedures at FAR subpart 33.104 to the GAO.

Ombudsman
At the IDIQ contract level, subject to GSAM 552.216-74, GSA has appointed the required Ombudsman to
resolve complaints related to fair opportunity in the ordering process consistent with the procedures of
HCaTS and to review HCaTS CO decisions to place Contractors in Dormant Status. There are two primary
duties of the Ombudsman: (1) To review complaints from Contractors and ensure that they are afforded
a fair opportunity for consideration in the award of task orders consistent with the procedures of HCaTS,
and (2) To review an HCaTS CO decision to place a Contractor in Dormant Status.
For more information about GSA’s Procurement Ombudsman visit gsa.gov/ombudsman.

Reporting Task Order Awards in FPDS-NG
Task order awards shall be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System – Next Generation (FPDSNG) within 3 days after execution of the action. This requirement also applies to agencies that may no
otherwise be required to create FPDS-NG reports (i.e. agencies that do not receive appropriated funds),
as the Service Contract Reporting (SCR) link in SAM.GOV is activated based on FPDS-NG data. It is
important that each HCaTS task order is reported as an order under the correct HCaTS contract number,
identifying the appropriate NAICS Code and PSC. Use the following NAICS Code to report the task orders
in the FPDS-NG system:
-

Predominant NAICS Code for Pool 1: 611430
Predominant NAICS Code for Pool 2: 541612

It is also important that FPDS-NG accurately reflects the requirements ordered and task order
solicitation procedures used to award task orders under HCaTS. To ensure that your agency gets proper
credit for your awards, make sure your FPDS-NG reports accurately reflect the appropriate values in all
fields related to award data.

Post-Award Survey
Approximately within 30 days after a task order award under HCaTS, the HCaTS PMO will send a survey
from to the awarding CO to collect information regarding the acquisition process and the offers. This
survey is required for the HCaTS program data transactional report.

Step 6: Task Order Administration
Reporting Modifications in FPDS-NG
All task order modifications involving price or scope changes must be reported in FPDS-NG. This
requirement also applies to agencies that may not otherwise be required to create FPDS-NG reports (i.e.
agencies that do not receive appropriated funds), as the Service Contract Reporting (SCR) link in
SAM.GOV is activated based on FPDS-NG data.
12 of 14

Reporting Modifications to GSA
Within 30 days after awarding a task order modification involving price or scope changes, use the form
at Appendix H, Task Order Modification Information Form to report the action to GSA.

Subcontracting and Limitations on Subcontracting
FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (Jan 2017), incorporated by reference at the MAIDIQ contract level and will be monitored and enforced by the HCaTS PMO.

Performance Evaluation
Each OCO is responsible for ensuring that the contractor’s performance on each order is reported in
CPARS in accordance with the policies in FAR Subpart 42.15. Follow your agency’s procedures for
preparation, review, and submission of performance reports. GSA will consider task order performance
information as part of performance evaluations at the IDIQ contract level. Task order performance may
also be considered in placing contractors in dormant status.

Step 7: Task Order Closeout
The OCO is responsible for closing out their task orders. Task order files shall be closed out in
accordance with the procedures in FAR Subsection 4.804-1. The procedures prescribed in FAR
Subsection 4.804-5 shall be used for closing out the contract file except when it is appropriate to use the
quick-closeout procedure in FAR Section 42.708.
