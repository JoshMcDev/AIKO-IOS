Electronic Records Management (ERM)
Buying Tips

1. Engage NARA and GSA: ​NARA and GSA have partnered to develop a premier solution
for agencies looking to implement an ERM solution. Through this partnership we have
assisted several agencies in developing their requirements and reviewing acquisition
strategies. Take advantage of best practices by reaching out to the NARA and GSA
eams early in the process. Please contact: ​RecordsManagement@gsa.gov

2. Needs Assessment:​ The overwhelming feedback GSA has received from its industry
partners is that ALL agencies should be conducting a needs assessment as a first step
o their ERM procurement process. This assessment will help an agency avoid
purchasing a solution that does not properly suit their needs or that cannot efficiently
manage the agency’s records.

3. Surveying Contractors: ​It is crucial to know the available providers and their
capabilities. GSA recommends issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on GSA eBuy to
help determine this information. GSA can assist you with this process or using the
MRAS process described below, GSA can issue the RFI on your behalf. Agencies may
also consider a Pre-Quote Conference or Industry Day to announce their requiremen
and gain valuable information from industry partners

4. Utilize Market Research as a Service (MRAS):​ ​Let GSA’s Market Research As a
Service (MRAS) team assist your agency in finding GSA Contract holders capable of

5. Market Research GSA’s Discovery tool:​ GSA ​Discovery​is a market research tool that
helps you explore GSA services contracts, vendors, and vendor contract history to

determine whether a GSA contract can meet your needs. GSA added its ERM vendors
under the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program to simplify the market research
process, making it easier to search for ERM providers and their capabilities.
6. Think Enterprise-Wide: ​Whenever possible, consider taking an enterprise-wide
approach to managing agency records. Developing ERM solutions for individual
divisions or branches within an agency presents long-term challenges in managing and
searching records. Maximizing the use of enterprise-wide solutions will enable a more
efficient records management environment.

7. Managing Cultural Change within the Organization:​ There will likely be disruption to
records owners during implementation, particularly if document scanning is involved,
making it important to describe the benefits of the solution and managing expectations.
Engagement from senior management will help champion these efforts and increase the
likelihood of success.

8. Anticipating Future Needs: ​To the maximum extent practicable, consider the future
records management needs of your agency. Explore available technologies and engage
industry to project future needs and capabilities.
