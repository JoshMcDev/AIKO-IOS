At-a-Glance Contract Comparison Chart

The following “meatball” chart maps contract vehicles (y axis) to their corresponding features (x axis). The objective of the chart is to provide
readers with a quick, at-a-glance tool to learn and compare the features of a sampling of available IT contract vehicles. With ease of use and
readability in mind, the SIG committee selected 15 features to highlight across contract vehicles. If the contract vehicle offers a listed feature, a
green dot or “meatball” is shown at the intersection of the named vehicle and the feature. If the vehicle does not have the feature, the cell is blank.
As demonstrated in the chart below, the Alliant 2 GWAC offers the most comprehensive features and benefits to Government Agency customers.
Contract vehicles are listed in alphabetical order. Each of the listed contract vehicles has a corresponding Contract Comparison Worksheet in
Section VI.

Ten (10) Leading Edge Technologies (LETs) are specifically identified in the contract such as
Agile Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Autonomic Computing. Industry
Partners have proven capabilities across the LETs. New technologies introduced during the
period of performance of the contract are automatically within the scope of the contract and do no
require a contract modification.
Alliant 2 can accommodate the largest IT projects. The $50B program ceiling allows for long-term
planning of large-scale program requirements.
Alliant 2 is a long-term contract with a 5-year base period (2018 – 2023) and 5-year option period
(2023 – 2028). As a follow-on contract to Alliant, Alliant 2 reduces potential contract gaps and
administration related to recurring RFPs/RFQs. Task Orders awarded during the term of the
contract can extend 5 years beyond the contract term (2018 – 2028) to 2033.
Alliant 2 offers customers multi-year orders with option years and order type flexibility to include
he following contract types:
 Cost Reimbursement – Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Cos
Plus Award Fee (CPAF)
 Firm Fixed Price (FFP)
 Time & Materials (T&M)
 Labor Hour
 Hybrid; Combination of contract types
Alliant 2 offers a low Contract Access Fee (CAF) of .75%. The fee is capped at $150K per year,
per order for orders placed through Direct Acquisition and applies to orders in excess of
$20M/year. For example, if a customer’s Direct Acquisition requirement contract value is $20M
per year or more, the CAF will not exceed $150K per year. The fee is capped at $100K per year,
per order for orders placed through GSA’s Assisted Acquisition Service and applies to orders in
excess of $13.3M/year. This will result in considerable fee savings for large programs. See the
Alliant 2 CAF CAP memo on GSA’s website for more information.

GSA determined that published Alliant 2 industry partner labor rates are considered fair and
reasonable and applicable for the use of T&M Contracts. Alliant 2 offers flexibility in labor rates for
CPFF and FFP contracts by authorizing OCOs to determine fair and reasonable pricing for their
contracts. T&M and Labor Hour rates max out at the published bid rate unless special clearance
above Secret or other requirements apply at the Task Order level. Labor rates can be adjusted to
accommodate requirements such as high-level security clearances and special skills. Alliant 2
accommodates As-a-Service pricing.
Customers may tailor labor categories and rates at the Task Order level. Customers may add and
Industry Partners may propose new labor categories and rates at the Task Order and Master
Contract levels. This provides flexibility to customers and helps to customize Task Orders to
specific agency needs.
Alliant 2 Small Business Subcontracting Plans are established at the Master Contract level and
customers may establish small business subcontracting requirements at the Task Order level.
There are no named subcontractors at the Master Contract level thereby allowing primes the
flexibility to subcontract at the Task Order level when actual Task Order requirements are known.
Any Federal Agency may use Alliant 2 to procure services for requirements located anywhere in
he world. Alliant and Alliant 2 have a record of broad acceptance and usage by Federal Agencies
with global location requirements.
Alliant 2 offers a large number of highly qualified prime contractors (51). Prime contractors have
been vetted and determined by GSA to be qualified to perform the full range of IT services.
Primes competed to be on the Alliant 2 vehicle and are attuned to the Federal and DoD enterprise
architectures.
All contractors are typically required to submit at least three (3) bids every contract year. This
promotes competition on the vehicle.
GSA’s Alliant 2 Program Office is available to provide a full range of support including free scope
reviews within a 5 business day turnaround once submitted through the Scope Review online tool.
This service promotes contract compliance and reduces risk of adverse audits.
FAR 16.505 Streamlined Ordering Procedures, applies to Alliant 2. This means that because the
contract is already competed at the master contract level, customers can focus on the actual work
o be performed at the Task Order level, quickly create customized Task Order solicitations tha
include evaluation criteria that are unique to each Task Order. Alliant 2 offers ordering contracting
officers acquisition flexibility and autonomy. To assist customers, Alliant 2 offers a comprehensive
how-to Ordering Guide and various templates including Statements of Objectives and
Performance Work Statements. Alliant 2 encourages performance-based Task Orders.
For an additional fee (beyond the standard Contract Access Fee of .75%), GSA offers scalable
Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS) to support customers’ needs for services such as:
requirements definition guidance, assistance determining evaluation criteria, articulating
performance-based requirements, and/or procurement process and communication support.
FEDSIM is a Client Support Center within the General Services Administration’s Office of
Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS). FEDSIM’s services include acquisition, financial, and
5

project management for the full acquisition life cycle. Traditionally, FEDSIM focuses on complex
acquisitions and their acquisition and program management staff has a deep understanding of IT
and professional services.
GSA Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS) also provides post-award services including custom
financial management support services, project management, and scalable approaches tha
reduce risk on even the most complex projects. While GSA is predisposed to use GSA vehicles,
here are some rare occasions where GSA AAS will use non-GSA vehicles.
This following subsection showcases additional Alliant 2 features and benefits which can be inserted into the “Bonus Features” section of the

The Alliant 2 contract vehicle encourages Industry Partners to provide solutions-based proposals
– to include IT services, hardware, software, and other ancillary services, as necessary, to
provide a total solution to a customer’s requirements.
Sole source task orders are an available option on Alliant 2 when the ordering agency completes
he associated justification and approval documentation and publicizes it through a Governmen
Point of Entry (GPE) within 30 days of award.
GSA administers Alliant 2 at the Master Contract level. Customers can manage Task Orders
independently or they can pay an extra fee to obtain GSA support services. Assisted Acquisition
Service fee is negotiated between customers and GSA. Alliant 2 customers may administer
(direct order/direct bill Task Orders) without GSA’s involvement. A Memo of Understanding and
Delegation of Authority from GSA to the customer’s Contracting Officer is required.
The Alliant 2 Master Contract was competitively awarded and Task Orders are competed among
all prime contract holders. The Master Contract contains annual participation and production
performance goals for Industry Partners. The contract meets Section 803 requirements for fair
opportunity.
No protests on civilian agency awards that are $10 million and under; except on the grounds tha
he order increases the scope, period of performance, or maximum value of the GWAC. For DoD,
NASA, or the Coast Guard, no protests on orders $25M and under. This minimizes protest risk
and supports timely order award for optimal mission support.
