The Government-wide Strategic Solutions
(GSS) for Desktops and Laptops Program
The GSS for Desktops and Laptops Program was
established in Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Memo M-16-02. Memo M-16-02 requires federal
civilian agencies to leverage the GSS Best-in Class (BIC)
contracts for laptop and desktop purchases (unique or
super high-performance computers may not be available
via the GSS contracts). The program is specifically
designed to standardize configurations and provide
computers that meet 80% of the federal government’s
laptop and desktop needs.

Strategic Solutions for Desktops and Laptops Program

Configurations and specifications are reviewed annually
and updated (as necessary) by the Workstations
Category Team (WCT), which is composed of the GSS
BIC solutions and other federal agency contributors.

GSA’s AdvantageSelectSM GSS Blanket
Purchase Agreement (BPA) Program
The fundamental purpose of the GSA AdvantageSelec
Government-wide Strategic Solutions (GSS) BPAs is
o provide a streamlined process and to leverage the
government’s buying power for procuring laptops,
desktops, peripherals, and ancillary supplies and
services. The BPAs are available for use by the federal
government (civilian and military) – as well as by state,
local, and tribal government entities through GSA’s
Cooperative Purchasing Program.
The GSS BPAs are FAR-compliant, pre-competed,
short-term, brand-name (or equal), single-award BPAs
for all Dell™, HP®, Lenovo®, and Microsoft® notebooks
hat meet GSS standard configurations and options for
configuring to agency needs. The period of performance
is one year with four one-year options (for example,

4

Strategic Solutions for Desktops and Laptops Program

September 4, 2022 – September 3, 2027). BPA pricing
is for quantity of one for each machine offered. Discounts
are available when larger quantities are solicited.
The BPAs are available to all federal, state, local, and
ribal agencies/entities eligible to purchase from the
GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program.
The GSA AdvantageSelect BPAs were issued in
accordance with FAR 8.405-3(c)(1) and awarded
using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA)
source-selection process. BPAs established under
he Federal Supply Schedule are exempt from the
requirements in FAR Part 6. In accordance with FAR
8.405-3(c)(1) (Single-award BPA), government buyers
may place orders directly under the established BPA
when the need for the supply or service arises. With

the GSA AdvantageSelect BPAs, additional competition
requirements are not required. A buyer simply selects
an item, enters the quantity, and pays for the order
– without worrying about managing an extended
competitive process.
The BPAs were solicited and issued using a competitive
100% Small Business (SB) set-aside, brand-name (or equal)
acquisition strategy. Consideration was not restricted
o any one particular vendor or brand. FAR 8.405-6
(Limiting sources) does not apply, and agencies are no
required to complete a Limited Sources Justification.
GSS BPA desktops and laptops can be customized to
meet customer requirements. All in-scope options and
accessories on a vendor’s GSA contract can be offered
on the BPA and used to configure the base GSS machine
o agency needs. Options include, but are not limited to:
• Base machine: larger SSD, CPU upgrade, RAM
upgrade, graphics card upgrade
• Peripherals: monitors, docking stations, carrying
cases, speakers, keyboards
• Services: warranty upgrade (four- and five-year),
imaging, secure imaging (GFE server–based), asse
agging, ship direct/ready for use (vice customer
warehousing/configuring)
The GSA IT Hardware category offers supplemental
program support for our customers, including:
• Order management support (regular meetings)
• Prices paid information/reports
• For larger quantities and/or establishing an
agencywide catalog, GSA will assist in seeking
additional discounts
To enable demand consolidation and price stabilization,
GSA’s BPAs offer an agency catalog option that allows
a customer to establish a catalog against a BPA through
which they can negotiate an agencywide price based on
approximate spend and quantity for a fiscal year, even if
ordering happens at multiple buying offices across the
globe. This allows the entire agency to take advantage
of bulk pricing and shortened acquisition lead times.
The GSS BPAs currently have several agencies –
including SOCOM, HHS HQ, CDC, and GSA – utilizing
he catalog process.

details to requisitions and purchase orders using the
"PO Note" field.

Check the accuracy of the information you provided

o submit your order, click the “Process Order” button.
Once you place your order, GSA Advantage!® will send
you a confirmation email.

Direct Ordering
If you cannot complete the purchase through GSA
Advantage! and would like to make a direct order with
he BPA holder, you can make the purchase one of three
ways. If you have a one-time requirement, you can issue a
Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) call order. If you are
going to have recurring requirements and want to establish
a catalog, you can create an agency-specific catalog to take
advantage of aggregate demand and increase the speed
of acquisition on those recurring requirements. Lastly, you
have the option to post an Request for Information (RFI)/
Request for Quotation (RFQ) in GSA eBuy.

1) Issuing a Call Order

To issue a call order, you simply need to contact the
BPA holder using the information above, provide your
requirements, and ask for an all-inclusive quotation.
Once the quotation is received, check to ensure all
prices are equal to or less than their BPA pricing. It is
always recommended to contact the vendor and ask for
additional discounts on their quotation prior to placing an
order. Issue your order.

2) Creating an Agency Catalog

The GSA IT Hardware category, in conjunction with our BPA
holders, has helped create a buying process for customers
who want to realize the savings associated with aggregated
demand and make more than one purchase via our GSS
BPAs. To start the process, a customer provides estimated
quantities along with the machines and configurations
required for each fiscal year. Our BPA holders will
seek additional discounts from the original equipmen
manufacturer (OEMs), based on those estimated quantities
and configurations, and create an agency-specific catalog
so that customers can cut orders against catalog withou
further competition of the requirement. The catalog is
refreshed quarterly to accommodate technology updates
and changes to the OEM product line. With a little work
up front, this process streamlines the acquisition process,
reducing acquisition time to approximately five days;
reduces price variability; and helps all agency buying units
realize greater cost savings.
