1.0 Introduction
Click here to learn about GSA BPAs: ​GSA BPAs Explained
This ordering guide will help you throughout the ordering process by explaining how to properly
place an order against the GSA 2GIT BPAs.
Who Will Benefit from this Guide?
This guide is designed for all contracting personnel considering or planning to use the 2GIT BPAs to
meet their acquisition requirements. It will aid contracting professionals in their use of 2GIT BPAs to
deliver solutions to meet mission needs and streamline the procurement process.
When properly administered, 2GIT offers federal contracting professionals a streamlined process
hat will reduce their procurement administrative lead time (PALT) through the use of streamlined
procedures found in FAR Subpart 8.405-3(c) Ordering from BPAs and this guide.
Purpose:​ This 2GIT ordering guide has been developed to complement the FAR, inclusive of the FAR
8.404-4(d) requirement, along with your agency's acquisition policies and guidelines.
Product Pricing – ​BPA holders were required to provide detailed pricing for explicitly defined,
standardized products, so customers can easily compare pricing for a single product (solution) across
BPA holders. Additional discounts may also be obtained at the delivery order level.
Standardized Requirements – ​BPA holders are required to meet standardized technical and security
requirements. Specific standards, guidance, and applicable documents within the BPAs are written
with the broad intent of accomplishing GSA customer IT hardware and software commodities
network centric strategies. Agency specific strategies may evolve over time and, when appropriate,
hose agencies will revise and replace their applicable standards accordingly. The BPA Holder shall
conform to customer strategies and visions and adhere to associated standards provided by the
customer. Agencies and departments may specify and substitute other standards, guidance, and
applicable documents within their orders that are appropriate to provide solutions tailored to mee
heir requirement network centric strategies.
Cybersecurity Technical Considerations:​ The BPA Holder shall ensure that all applicable
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and enabled products comply with ordering agency cybersecurity
guidelines when specified by the Ordering Agency Contracting Officer at the RFQ level. Additionally,
for DoD ordering agencies, these products must be Committee on National Security Systems
Policy-11 (CNSSP-11) compliant, requiring the BPA Holder’s products to be validated by accredited
labs under the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Evaluation and
Validation Scheme, or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), and/or Commercial
Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Components List, if required.
Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM):​ For orders to be placed under the BPA, ordering agencies
may include in their order-level solicitations additional SCRM-related clauses, regulations, or policies.
The SCRM plan, implementation, and risk assessment methodology processes shall follow Appendix

03/19/2020

D and E of NIST SP 800-161 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-161/final) and NISTIR
7622 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/7622/final) guidelines, ensuring application to
he BPA Holder and their suppliers, partners, distributors, and any other entity that is responsible for
handling or managing the supply chain of the products offered under these BPAs.
Any Information Security Management Systems (e.g. ISO 27K series) controls, or related program
standards, should be mapped to their associated NIST baseline controls, where applicable. The
supply chain shall span from the lowest sub-component producer or manufacturer to the delivery
point of the BPA Holder, or its designated agent, such as a distributor. The SCRM plan,
implementation, and risk assessment methodology processes shall follow Appendix D and E of NIST
SP 800-161 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-161/final) and NISTIR 7622
(https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/7622/final) guidelines, ensuring application to the
BPA Holder and their suppliers, partners, distributors, and any other entity that is responsible for
handling or managing the supply chain of the products offered under these BPAs. If a BPA Holder
represents a Prime/Subcontractor relationship then all SCRM plan requirements shall also be flowed
down to the respective subcontractor(s). The Prime shall be responsible for SCRM plan
implementation and adhere to reporting requirements represented by the defined relationship.
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID):​ When required and defined by the ordering activity at the
RFQ stage, the BPA Holder shall provide RFID tagging. For the Department of Defense customer RFID
agging shall be IAW DFARS 252.211-7006 and the most current version of DoD Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) Policy. The BPA Holder shall encode an approved RFID tag using instructions
provided in the EPC™ Tag Data Standards in effect at the time of award. Additional information can
also be found at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) for Logistics and Materiel
Readiness website

2GIT Regulatory Guidance:
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides the primary regulatory guidance for the GSA
Schedules program. The General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) is the GSA FAR supplement.
03/19/2020

The GSAR provides guidance tailored to GSA acquisitions, including GSA Schedules contracting. GSAR
guidance primarily affects GSA Schedules by providing supplementary guidance to the Contracting
Officers awarding and administering GSA Schedule contracts. FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply
Schedules, prescribes procedures that ordering activities must follow when issuing orders agains
GSA Schedules. Orders placed following these procedures are considered to be issued using full and
open competition. (See FAR Subpart 8.404(a)) FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items,
prescribes policies and procedures unique to the acquisition of commercial items.It states use of
MAS issued under the procedures established by the Administrator of General Services consisten
with the requirement of 41 U.S.C. 259(b)(3)(A) for the MAS program of the General Services
Administration is a competitive procedure.
All GSA Schedule contracts are awarded using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Any
agency utilizing GSA Schedules must use the procedures described in FAR Subpart 8.4. Some agencies
issue supplementary guidance to the FAR. For example, the DoD has the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (DFARS); the Army has the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplemen
(AFARS) in addition to the DFARS; and NASA has the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS). The competition
requirements for civilian agencies and DoD are the same. The one exception is the DoD requires the
Contracting Officer to consider additional steps IAW ​DFARS SUBPART 208-405​, when only one
response is received to a competitive solicitation over the SAT. | Multiple Award Schedules Training
Notes: Acquisition planning is required for all acquisitions over the micro-purchase threshold, which
is currently ​$10,000.​ FedBizOpps notice is only required post-award for a limited sources acquisition
(see FAR 8.405-6(a)(2). Responsibility determinations are made by GSA, at the contract level. Terms
and conditions are already set in the Schedule contracts. Fair and reasonable pricing has already
been determined in the Schedules, though over the SAT, agencies must request price reductions.
2.0 Seven Steps to Order from 2GIT BPAs:
This section provides seven simple steps necessary to place an order under the 2GIT BPAs.
A representative from GSA is available to answer any questions that may arise. Please send inquiries
o ​2git@gsa.gov​.
2.1 Scope Determination:
Establish Ordering Activity Requirements
First, determine if the requirement is within scope of the 2GIT BPAs, as defined above in previous
paragraphs.

03/19/2020

2.2 P
​ repare ​Bill of Material / Commodity List / Product Solution as appropriate.
Follow the procedures under FAR 8.405-3 Blanket Purchase Agreements (c) ​Ordering from BPAs.​
(2) ​Multiple-award BPAs​.
(i) Orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold. The ordering activity may place orders a
or below the micro-purchase threshold with any BPA holder that can meet the agency needs. The
ordering activity should attempt to distribute any such orders among the BPA holders.
(ii) Orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold but not exceeding the simplified
acquisition threshold.
(A) The ordering activity must provide each multiple-award BPA holder a fair opportunity to be
considered for each order exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified
acquisition threshold unless one of the exceptions at​ ​8.405-6​(a)(1)(i) applies.
(B) The ordering activity need not contact each of the multiple-award BPA holders before placing an
order if information is available to ensure that each BPA holder is provided a fair opportunity to be
considered for each order.
(C) The ordering activity contracting officer shall document the circumstances when restricting
consideration to less than all multiple-award BPA holders offering the required supplies and services.
(iii) Orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.
(A) The ordering activity shall place an order in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(A)(​1)​ , (​2)​ and
(​3​) of this paragraph, unless the requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared
and approved in accordance with​ ​8.405-6​. The ordering activity shall(1) Provide an RFQ to all BPA holders offering the required supplies or services under the
multiple-award BPAs, to include a description of the supplies to be delivered or the services to be
performed and the basis upon which the selection will be made;
(2) Afford all BPA holders responding to the RFQ an opportunity to submit a quote;
and
(3) Fairly consider all responses received and make award in accordance with the selection
procedures.
(B) The ordering activity shall document evidence of compliance with these procedures and the basis
for the award decision.
Place of Delivery:
Ordering activities shall identify the delivery point(s).
Delivery of products will be to CONUS, OCONUS, and remote locations as identified below.
Additional delivery terms or schedules, such as ship-in-place, expedited shipping or shipping to
Army Post Office (APO)/Fleet Post Office (FPO) addresses, shall be negotiated between the

03/19/2020

BPA Holder and the Ordering Agency Contracting Officer at the delivery order level. The BPA
Holder shall have the capability to simultaneously deliver large volumes of products to multiple
locations worldwide.
1. CONUS: The 48 contiguous states, Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.
2. Named OCONUS: Outside the Continental United States.
3. Remote OCONUS: Will be identified at the RFQ stage by the ordering activity for those
locations that are not listed under CONUS or Named OCONUS. (e.g. Forward
Operating Bases in Afghanistan).
The following figure sets forth the maximum performance parameters for deliveries:
Timeframe CONUS OCONUS Remote OCONUS
Routine NLT 30 calendar days NLT 45 calendar days NLT 45 calendar days

Period of Performance:
The term of the 2GIT BPA(s) is five (5) years: Nov 1, 2019 through Oct 31, 2024.
2GIT BPAs were awarded under current MAS Contracts. ​Any order issued (including its order
options) against an existing BPA before the BPA expires will have its own Period of Performance
(including order options). It shall be completed (including any order options) according to the
Schedule Contract FAR clause 52.216-22(d), which states,
“Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period
shall be completed by the contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern
he contractor’s and government’s rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same
extent as if the order were completed during the contract’s effective period, provided that the
contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after the completion of
customer order, including options, 60 months following the expiration of the basic contract ordering
period.”
2.3 Prepare Request for Quote (RFQ)
