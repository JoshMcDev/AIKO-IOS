Introduction
With the increased demand for identity protection services and ever-changing requirements of
need by our customer agencies, the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of
Professional Services and Human Capital Categories (PSHC) has redefined Special Item
Number (SIN) 541990IPS as its official Data Breach Response and Identity Protection Services
(IPS) SIN on the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).
Redefining the SIN now allows industry to provide current state-of-the-art identity protection
services (identity monitoring and notification of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and
Protected Health Information (PHI), identity theft insurance and identity restoration services, and
protection (safeguard) of the confidentiality of PII and PHI) while giving you the ability to mee
your individual requirements.
The redefined SIN 541990IPS allows for a total solution for identity protection services and
affords the ordering office to tailor their scope for only selective segments of services found
under this SIN. For example an ordering office may have a suspected breach, but due to the
uncertainty, may only want to seek credit monitoring services that do not require call center
support, identity restoration, etc. You will now have the ability to obtain specifically what is
needed for your immediate situation.

Who is this Guide Written for?
This guide describes the ordering process for agency users, highlighting procedures specific to
he IPS SIN. It is written for warranted Federal ordering contracting officers (OCOs) considering
or intending to use the IPS SIN. The guide addresses contracting issues and concepts unique to
he IPS SIN. It does not address general contracting issues or concepts unless necessary for
complete understanding. The guide presumes the OCO is familiar with Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) 8.405 ordering procedures.

Roles and Responsibilities
GSA is responsible for the administration and management of the IPS SIN and the Schedule
contracts. Among the responsibilities GSA will meet are:

Fund requirements
Apply regulatory and statutory requirements applicable to the ordering agency

Authorized Users
Any warranted Contracting Officer from authorized users of the Schedules program, within the
scope of their delegated procurement authorities, may place orders against the IPS SIN.

Task Order Terms and Conditions
In the event of any conflict between the Schedule contract and the task order, the terms and
conditions of the contractor’s Schedule contract shall prevail over the task order.
Ordering activities may add non-conflicting terms and conditions to individual orders, to include
specific agency terms and conditions. Additionally, any clauses incorporated at the task order
level required for small business set-aside orders shall be applicable to that order even if those
clauses have not been incorporated to the Schedule contract.

General Ordering Procedures
Step 1 – Acquisition Planning
Orders against Schedule contracts and BPAs are not exempt from Acquisition Planning as
prescribed in FAR Part 7.
Conduct market research for your requirement in accordance with regulation as you would do
with any procurement. As part of sound market research, the Schedule contract terms and
conditions, Schedule contract holders, and Schedule contract pricing shall be reviewed.
Important considerations in developing your acquisition plan include:

Whether to Issue a Task Order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)
If you are responding to a recent breach, then a task order is the most appropriate option. If you
are in the process of preparing your agency to respond to a breach that may happen in the
future, then a BPA is more appropriate.

Pricing
Pricing is established at the Schedule contract level for a total solution of IPS. The total solution
includes the following services as outlined in Section I of the IPS Requirements Document 1A):
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Security And Security Related Reporting
Post Award Data Incident Reporting
Data Breach Response And Identity Theft Services
Call Center Services
Notification
Credit Monitoring Services
Identity Monitoring
Identity Theft Insurance
Identity Restoration Services
Required Reports
Data Safeguards And Disposal
Task Order Award Reporting

Pricing for the total solution is offered in two ways: a Firm Fixed Price Per Year, Per Impacted
Individual (Per Impacted Individual) rate, and a Firm Fixed Price Per Year, Per Enrollee (Per
Enrollee) rate. Which method an agency chooses depends on the circumstances surrounding
he requirements.The table below describes the differences between the Per Impacted
Individual rate and the Per Enrollee rate.
Pricing Method

Firm Fixed Price Per
Year, Per Enrollee

Description

Example

The ordering agency pays the quoted price for
each Enrollee only. The Per Enrollee rate is
used in situations where you know that mos
or all individuals impacted by a breach will
enroll in the services.

A Government official
mistakenly exposes the PII of
10 employees. The ordering
agency should procure total
solution services for all 10
employees at the Per Enrollee
rate because the impacted
population is small and well
defined; therefore, there is a
high likelihood that all 10
employees will enroll in the
otal solution services.

Firm Fixed Price Per
Year, Per Impacted
Individual

The ordering agency pays the quoted price
for each Impacted Individual, regardless of
enrollment status. This total solution pricing is
used when the enrollment rate of the breach
(i.e., the number of individuals impacted by a
breach who will actually enroll in identity
protection services) is unknown to your
agency. The contractor will provide notice to
every impacted individual, but only impacted
individuals who respond to the notice and
enroll in services will receive credi
monitoring, identity monitoring, etc. Note tha
his method requires uncertainty as to the
number of actual enrollees. This method is
not appropriate for a small scale breach or
where there is a high likelihood that the
enrollment rate will be near 100%.

A data breach occurred
involving a database containing
PII on 10,000 members of the
public. The ordering agency
should procure total solution
services for all 10,000 people a
he Per Impacted Individual
rate. The Per Impacted
Individual rate is appropriate
because the impacted
population is large and there is
uncertainty about how many will
actually respond to the notice
and enroll in the total solution
services.

The standardized total solution offerings and units of issue allow you to make “apples-to-apples”
price comparisons between Schedule contractors under the IPS SIN. You still maintain the
flexibility to utilize this fixed pricing as a basis to request further fixed prices at the task order
level (e.g., “per product redeemed per the agreed-upon coverage period (month, year, etc.)”).
Furthermore, you have the flexibility to order some (“a la carte”) or all (“total solution”) of the
services as defined in SIN 541990IPS. There are also additional services as customized
solutions that can only be ordered in addition to IPS Requirements Document 1A Section I
services. Examples of such additional services include 1) data breach analysis/forensic
services, 2) subsequent credit reports, and 3) offline mail services in addition to online services
for those individuals who indicate that they need a different means to access information
associated with credit monitoring, identity monitoring, and identity protection.
Any order not issued on a firm fixed price basis must be justified in accordance with FAR
8.404(h)(3).

NAICS Code
The services under the IPS SIN are aligned with the North American Industrial Classification
System (NAICS) code of 541990 – All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.
This NAICS code of 541990 that you assign to your task order will not necessarily be the same
code assigned to the task order award report in the Federal Procurement Data System – Nex
Generation (FPDS-NG). This is due to the current FPDS-NG system limitation which defaults all
orders to the NAICS code assigned at the Schedule contract level which is shown for each
contractor in eLibrary.

Task Order Funding and Funding Limitations
All task orders are subject to any agency funding appropriation limitations.

Task Order Duration
The period of performance for each task order awarded under the IPS SIN shall be specified in
he task order by the ordering activity. Orders issued will have their own period of performance.
Orders issued prior to but not completed before the Schedule contract expires shall be
completed (including any order options exercised) in accordance with the Schedule contrac
FAR Clause 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity.

Minimum and Maximum Order Limitations
Each Schedule contract contains FAR Clause 52.216-19, Order Limitations. The minimum order
limitation dollar value may vary depending on the contract. The minimum order limitation is
posted on each contractor’s Schedule price list. The maximum order limitation dollar value is $1
million. The maximum order limitation is the price at which an ordering agency is required to
seek additional discounts off of the awarded schedule prices.

Step 2 – Define the Requirements and Develop the RFQ
The ordering activity must follow the ordering procedures at FAR 8.405 for orders under Federal
Supply Schedules.
a. Develop a SOW in accordance with (IAW) FAR 8.405-2 if a SOW is required. The SOW
must include a description of the work to be performed, location of work, period of
performance, deliverable schedule, applicable performance standards, and any special
requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, etc.).
b. Ensure the requirements fit within the scope of the IPS SIN.
c. The ordering activity may include agency specific regulations/terms and conditions in the
ask order that do not conflict with the Schedule contract.
d. The ordering activity shall ensure all internal reviews (e.g. legal review) as required by
ordering activity policies have been completed.
e. The ordering activity agency may utilize Order Level Materials (OLM) procedures to
acquire other direct costs (ODCs) and material support items to meet the requirements
of a specific order. For more information on OLMs, see www.gsa.gov/olm.
f. Use the RFQ form and format normally prescribed and used by your agency for task
order RFQs, consistent with FAR 8.405.

Step 3 – Issue the RFQ
To ensure fair opportunity, the suggested method for issuing the task order RFQ is to utilize
GSA eBuy.

Step 4 – Evaluate Quotes
OCOs must evaluate all responses received based on the methodology stated in the task order
RFQ to maintain fairness in the ordering process and mitigate protest risk. Place the order with
he Schedule contractor that represents the best value.

Step 5 – Award the Task Order and Reporting Requirements
Document your task order award in accordance with regulation and local policy. At a minimum,
all orders shall include the following information:
a. Complete shipping and billing addresses
b. Task order / BPA number
c. Agency order number
d. Discount terms (if applicable)
e. Period of performance
f. SIN 541990IPS
g. SOW (if required)
h. Number of units
i. Unit of measure
j. Unit price
k. Pricing Method (“Per Enrollee”, “Per Impacted Individual”, etc.)
l. Total price of order
Task order awards shall specify the number of units acquired and the awarded price per unit.
Additionally, if an order contains some (“a la carte”) services and not all (“total solution”)
services, then the task order award shall specify the number of units acquired and the awarded
price per unit for each individual service.
Order actions must be reported in FPDS within three days after execution of the action.
Email notification of the award shall also be submitted to GSA at ips_pss@gsa.gov within five
days after execution of the action. The email notification shall consist of a copy of the task order
award, including the SOW if applicable, and a brief description of the task and total price of the
order.

Step 6 – Administer the Order/Execute the Work/Close-Out the Order
The ordering activity is responsible for administering the resulting task order.
The ordering activity is responsible for ensuring that the contractor’s performance on each order
is reported in CPARS in accordance with the policies in FAR Subpart 42.15. Follow your agency
procedures for preparation, review, and submission of performance reports.
Task order files shall be closed out in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.804-1 or, if the task order
is administered by another office, 4.804-2. The procedures prescribed in FAR Subpart 4.804-5
shall be used except when it is appropriate to use the quick closeout procedures in FAR Subpar
42.708.
