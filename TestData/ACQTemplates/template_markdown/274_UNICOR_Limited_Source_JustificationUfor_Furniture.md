Buying Furniture? Read About the UNICOR Limited Source Justification
Background
UNICOR (Federal Prison Industries) is a mandatory source of supply for certain items
similar to those on GSA Schedules. Ordering activities are encouraged to purchase
UNICOR supplies and services to the maximum extent practicable.
UNICOR is a critical component of the Bureau of Prisons’ comprehensive efforts to
improve offender reentry. By providing inmates with the skills needed to join the
workforce upon release, UNICOR reduces an inmate’s likelihood of relapse into criminal
behavior while helping curb the rising costs of corrections.
Policy Overview
In accordance with FAR 8.6, if a UNICOR supply item meets the ordering activity's
requirement, before purchasing the item from UNICOR, the ordering activity should
conduct market research to determine whether the UNICOR item is comparable to
supplies available from the private sector that best meet the government's needs in
erms of price, quality, and time of delivery. If the UNICOR item is comparable, the
ordering activity should follow UNICOR's ordering procedures and purchase the item
from UNICOR, unless UNICOR grants a waiver (FAR 8.604), or one of the
circumstances in FAR 8.605 applies. Visit UNICOR's website to view a list of UNICOR
supplies and services, and to access​ UNICOR's ordering procedures​.
Note
FAR 8.002 specifies the order of priority when acquiring supplies or services. Although
UNICOR has priority over GSA Schedules for supplies, GSA Schedules have priority
over UNICOR for services.
