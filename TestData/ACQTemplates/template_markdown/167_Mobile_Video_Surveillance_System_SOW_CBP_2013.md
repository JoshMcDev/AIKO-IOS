Background
1.1. Border Patrol Responsibility and Mission Elements

The U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) is responsible for securing the Nation’s borders against
he illegal entry of people and goods between ports of entry (POE). To accomplish this,
USBP uses a mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel to manage the land
borders. These three resources are used to execute the mission elements of:





Predicting and deterring illicit activity;
Detecting and tracking illegal border crossings
Identifying and classifying the incursions, and
Responding to and resolving those incursions.

The Mobile Video Surveillance System (MVSS) Program contributes towards fulfillment
of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 – 2014
Strategic Plan, Objective 1.1:
Establish and maintain effective control of air, land, and maritime borders through
he use of the appropriate mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel.
In addition, the MVSS Program supports the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Quadrennial Homeland Security Review of February 2010 Mission: Securing and
Managing Our Borders, Goal 2.1:
Effectively control U.S. Air, Land and Sea Borders.
The CBP Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (OTIA) enables the execution
of the CBP mission elements through acquiring, fielding, testing and sustaining
surveillance capabilities, including the MVSS.
The MVSS enables USBP to efficiently monitor selected Areas of Coverage (AoC)1
within an Area of Interest (AoI) and is the preferred solution in certain urban, rural, and
remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor with other systems.
Each MVSS will provide a day/night surveillance capability that can be deployed on
USBP 4x4 vehicles wherever they can safely maneuver. The MVSS will be deployed for
day or night use to provide surveillance when intelligence indicators signal that Items of
Interest (IoIs) are in or approaching an area. They will also be deployed to augment fixed
surveillance systems that have line-of-sight (LoS) coverage gaps caused by existing
infrastructure, terrain (e.g., ravines or washes), or vegetation. While day use can occur,

1

Area of Coverage (AoC): The resulting areas, considering MVSS location, view shed and line-of-sight
obstructions, etc., within which USBP can successfully conduct surveillance activities using the
system. When used in a broader context, AoC can also refer to the coverage provided by a
combination of surveillance systems.

Doc No: OTIA02-MVSS-01-000001_Rev01

Page 3

MVSS Statement of Work (SOW)

most operations will occur at night. Each system will require one agent for operation of
he system and one or more agent(s) to respond to any detected traffic.

1.2. Operational and System Objectives
An MVSS enables USBP to continuously monitor targeted AoCs within an AoI. The
following MVSS operational and system objectives will enable the detection, tracking,
identification, and classification of IoIs:
 MVSS enables the operator to quickly deploy/redeploy the surveillance
system according to intelligence, shifts in illegal traffic , and daily operational
needs;
 MVSS provides a ruggedized surveillance system that will withstand off-road
ransport and frequent setup/breakdown cycles;
 MVSS displays video in near real-time2 at the operator interface;
 MVSS enables operator detection and tracking of IoIs within an AoC;
 MVSS enables operator identification to determine whether IoIs are human,
animal, or conveyance;
 MVSS enables operator classification to determine whether IoIs are engaged
in suspect activities, present a potential threat to an investigating Border Patrol
Agent (BPA), and the associated level of threat (e.g., number in group, wha
hey are carrying, and whether they are armed);
 MVSS enables near real-time operator control of system payload and
surveillance subsystems to track IoIs within the AoC;
 MVSS enables near real-time replay and video analysis to support detection,
racking, identification, and classification;
 MVSS provides the capability for data recording and extraction to suppor
external post-event data analysis and sharing;
 MVSS provides the capability to covertly illuminate IoIs so agents with nigh
vision goggles (NVG) can see them;
 MVSS provides the capability to monitor system health and status;
 MVSS is transferable between different makes and models of 4x4 vehicles in
he US Border Patrol (USBP) fleet (Attachment J-20);
 MVSS reliably performs the operational capabilities listed above in urban,
rural, and remote environments where access is limited and in all weather
conditions (including adverse and extreme) encountered along the U.S.
Southwest border.
These high level operational and system objectives are further defined in the Functional
Requirements Matrix (FRM) and the Environmental Requirements Matrix (ERM)
(Attachments J-3 and J-4).

2

Near real-time is defined as an extremely low-latency delay (less than one second). Low latency is
essential to successful operation of the system and more importantly agent safety.

1.3.

Concept of Operation

Figure 1 below provides a high level operational concept for MVSS. Each MVSS will be
responsible for monitoring its AoC that is comprised of the instantaneous field of view
(FoV)3 and the total field of regard (FoR).4
The MVSS mast will elevate the imaging devices to maximize the AoC and overcome
natural obstacles along the Southwest border such as terrain features, cane fields, and
cacti. The number of MVSSs deployed within each USBP sector will vary based on
geography, availability of equipment and trained operators, and operational need. Where
deployed, the system will provide the MVSS operator with video of sufficient quality and
resolution to enable the detection, tracking, identification, and classification of an IoI.
The MVSS will also provide IoI illumination to support covert vectoring of BPAs to the
immediate vicinity of the IoI for interdiction and event resolution.

Figure 1: MVSS High Level Operational Concept

1.3.1. Operational Scenario
In order to deploy the MVSS, an agent will drive the system over extremely rugged
errain, sometimes for long distances. The MVSS operator interface must not get in the
way or disrupt the driver while in transport. Once the system is deployed, the agent will
3

Field of view (FoV): The horizontal and vertical angles visible by or through a sensor at any specific
instant.
4
Field of regard (FoR): The total angular area through which the sensor can direct its field of view.

work an 8-10 hour shift. The operator interface shall allow the agent to be seated
comfortably and control the system and the Land Mobile Radio (LMR) easily for
extended periods of time. The agent shall be able to adjust the screen brightness and
monitor position as necessary. The operator interface controls shall be intuitive and
placed so that they are easy to reach (i.e., the agent shall not have to shift in his seat or si
up every time he needs to adjust the sensors).
Additionally, the agent will need to rapidly move the system from one deploymen
location to another. The system shall allow the agent to easily and quickly prepare the
MVSS for deployment to a different site. The MVSS operator display shall not impede
he agent’s ability to rapidly enter and exit the vehicle. Lastly, the vehicle’s LMR shall
be readily accessible to the agent while driving and while operating the MVSS system.

1.4.

Concept of Support and Sustainment

The system Contractor will provide initial MVSS support and maintenance. CBP will
ransition and assume responsibility for MVSS support and maintenance following
Contractor support. Night maintenance in the field is unlikely for safety reasons.
USBP agents may be expected to conduct limited troubleshooting activities, such as
subsystem reboots. USBP operators may be expected to perform minor maintenance in
he field, provided it does not require any special tools or skills outside of standard
operator training.

2

Scope

The Contractor shall provide two MVSSs, two MVSS Installation Kits, and twelve (12)
months of Contractor Logistics and Maintenance Support (CMLS), as well as any
associated data deliverables, in accordance with this Statement of Work (SOW).

Emergency “On-Call” support for the weekend and holidays shall be performed using the
same 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. timeframe used for the weekdays. The Contractor shall
provide a secure environment for Government property in accordance with CBP
Handbook 1400-02B Security Policy and Procedures (FOUO).

7.4. Maintenance Data Collection and Analysis
The Contractor shall use the following ground rules for purposes of meeting the FRM
requirements of Achieved Availability (Aa), Maximum Time To Repair (MAXTTR) and
Critical Failure Rate (), Preventative Maintenance (PM) Rate, and Time to Conduc
Preventive Maintenance.


Aa applies to MVSS failures (critical failure occurs when, in the opinion of the
BP, the IR camera, lift subsystem, power subsystem, operator interface or any
other component keeps the MVSS from effectively performing detection,
racking, identification, or classification) and MVSS Preventive Maintenance
events.
o The formula for Aa uses Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM)
events and Mean Maintenance Time (MMT) and is expressed as MTBM /
(MTBM + MMT).
o MTBM is calculated based on the average time between maintenance
events. Maintenance events occur when the system needs to be repaired
due to a critical failure or when scheduled preventative maintenance
occurs. The time between events is determined similarly to Mean Time
Between Failures, described below. MTBM is based on the time the
system is provided to Border Patrol until the time a critical failure occurs
or a PM event is required.
o MMT is calculated based on the average time the system stays at the
Contractor support facility for any maintenance event and is similar to
MaxTTR and time to conduct PM described below.
o Aa does not take into account Logistics Delay Times (LDT) or
Administrative Delay Times (ADT).
o Aa is tracked and reported for each MVSS.
o Aa metric will be tracked monthly for contract compliance.



Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) is calculated from the time the system is
provided to the Border Patrol until the time a critical failure occurs. Border Patrol
will notify the Contractor support facility during normal operating hours when a
critical failure occurs and the time it occurred. MTBF is not affected by
Preventative Maintenance events.

MVSS Statement of Work (SOW)


MaxTTR is calculated from the time the MVSS is delivered to the Contractor
support facility until it is restored to a Fully Mission Capable status and OBP is
notified it is ready for issue. MaxTTR is accrued during the hours the suppor
facility is open, however, if a MVSS is delivered for weekend or holiday repair
he MaxTTR will continue until the MVSS is ready for issue.



Critical Failure Rate is calculated over a rolling 90 day period.



A PM event is described as anytime the MVSS is taken to the Contractor support
facility to have PM actions conducted.



Similar to MaxTTR described above, the maximum time to conduct a
preventative maintenance event is calculated from the time the MVSS is delivered
o the Contractor support facility until it is restored to Fully Mission Capable
status and CBP is notified it is ready for issue.

The Contractor will be given access to the Government provided Integrated Logistics
Support System (ILSS) tool and shall use it for recording all MVSS maintenance data,
racking assets, inventory, procurements, metrics and related information to the Line
Replaceable Unit (LRU) level. The Government will make ILSS training available to the
Contractor online at no charge.
All Contractor personnel must obtain a final suitability clearance in accordance with DHS
and CBP policies, procedures, and regulations before access to the ILSS can be granted.
The Contractor shall provide the results of any maintenance related analysis to the
Government in the Monthly Activity Report (CDRL C-15).

7.5. Asset Management
The Contractor shall maintain a list of all MVSSs and Vehicle Installation Kits with all
part numbers, serial numbers, and bar codes for each asset assigned to the MVSS/Vehicle
Installation Kit with its implementation date and removal date.
Prior to Government Acceptance and during the Government full physical inventory, the
Contractor shall affix Government furnished barcodes to LRUs (replacement parts) in
accordance with the CBP Personal Property and Asset Management Handbook (HB
5200-13C) and the CBP Property and Asset Identification and Tagging Standard
(PAITS). This direction supports compliance with Office of Administration (OA)
directed Asset Management (AM) procedures and materials and list of parts barcoded
shall be reported along with other asset data in the Monthly Activity Report (CDRL C15).
After the barcodes have been affixed, the Government will input the following
information about the asset in ILSS:
