Facilities Maintenance and Management
At Your Service: Acquisition experts provide Best Value Solutions
o meet any need.

Simple, Streamlined Procurement
When you need complete facilities maintenance, but don’
have time to review proposals from a large list of vendors
or worry about time delays imposed when acquiring
Other Direct Costs (ODCs), our Building Maintenance and
Operations (BMO) strategic sourcing solution is a smar
option. Not only do standardized labor codes allow better
price comparisons, but detailed vendor transactional data
allows your agency to track purchasing trends. Additionally,
a zone-based award process provides a list of vendors who
can provide services to a larger region while still encouraging
small business participation.
Like BMO, Schedule 03FAC is a multiple-award, indefinite
delivery, indefinite quantity contract that offers a variety of
value-added services such as the ability to do small business
set-asides. However, Schedule 03FAC offers a continuous
process for adding new vendors. Both offer scope reviews,
market research and a Statement of Work (SOW) library.
But, when you need a large pool of vendors to choose from,
Schedule 03FAC is a sound choice. It’s ideal for specialized
services like hospital maintenance and cyber-security within
building controls.

spend under management for your federal agency.
