Battle Command Training Equipment (BCTE)

Part 1 General Information
1
General
This is a non-personal services contract to provide Program Management (PM),
engineering support services, logistics, procurement of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
(COTS) Information Technology (IT) hardware and software, licensing, furniture,
audiovisual and video teleconference equipment, installation services, and
Electronic Security Systems in support of the Battle Command Training Equipmen
(BCTE) mission to provide training enablers for Mission Training Complex (MTC)
locations and new MTC Military Construction, Army (MCA) projects. This effor
includes the purchase of hardware and necessary licenses for the Joint Land
Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC). The Government shall no
exercise any supervision or control over prime contractor employees or
subcontractor employees, if any. In addition the subcontractors, if any, shall be
accountable solely to the prime contractor who, in turn, is responsible to the
Government.
1.1
Description of Services
The Contractor shall provide personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities,
ransportation, tools, materials, supervision, labor and other items necessary to
perform PM, Risk Management Framework, engineering support services,
logistics, procurement of COTS IT hardware and software, furniture, audiovisual
and video teleconference equipmentand installation services at various MTC
locations in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental
United States (OCONUS) as defined in thisPerformance Work Statement (PWS).
1.2
Background
The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and
Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement to equip MTC locations with the
raining enablers needed to conduct individual and collective Mission Command
(MC) training. The MTC serves as the installation’s focal point for integrated Home
Station Training by integrating multiple training assets - facilities, technical and
support personnel, live digital ranges, virtual simulators and simulations and
constructive simulation in support of mission command training (individual, leader,
crew/section, battle staff, collective) for operational units. The BCTE program

1

provides training enablers to 34 MTC locations supporting the Active Component
(AC), Army National Guard (ARNG) and US Army Reserve (USAR) at CONUS and
OCONUS installations. In addition to providing the initial fielding, PEO STRI has the
requirement to provide life cycle replacement of COTS IT hardware and software
required to meet the Cybersecurity and Risk Management Framework (RMF)
policies for Department of Defense (DoD) IT systems to maintain cybersecurity and
replacement of defective furniture, fixtures & equipment (FFE) during the
performance of this contract. BCTE enables training effectiveness by providing the
MTC with an improved ability to link constructive simulations with MC training;
connecting the training environment to the operational environments. All hardware
and software required to support JLCCTC at various sites worldwide is included.
JLCCTC is a scalable architecture consisting of various configurations made up of
multiple security enclaves: Lower Enclave (LE), Middle Enclave (ME) and Upper
Enclave (UE). Each enclave is composed of a server based Technical Control and a
collection of user workstations. A JLCCTC Technical (Tech) Control is required for
each enclave. The number of enclaves at a given JLCCTC site is dependent upon tha
site’s designation. Sites can host a Single Enclave (SE), Dual Enclave (DE), and/or
hree enclave configuration. A multi enclave site consists of two or more enclaves with
each paring of enclaves connected by a Cross Domain Solution (CDS). The collection
of user workstations at a given site, or across the JLCCTC sites can be comprised of
different computer desktop types, computer laptop types or thin clients. The quantity
of user workstations at each JLCCTC site may vary but typically falls within 3 ranges
(Small, Medium or Large). Each enclave operates at a unique security classification
level.
The Contractor will recommend the best hardware solution(s) based on
specifications to be supplied by the Government. The best hardware solution will
result from the analysis of multiple factors to include: cost, capability, performance,
reliability, supportability and quality.
Products to be procured under this contract will be acquired only at the direction
and approval of the Government. Products acquired must be on the Government’s
Approved Products list.
