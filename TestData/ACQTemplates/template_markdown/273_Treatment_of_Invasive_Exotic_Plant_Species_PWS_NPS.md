Performance Work Statement (PWS)
Treatment of Invasive Exotic Plant Species
Great Smoky Mountains National Park
Gatlinburg, Sevier county, TN

1. Background.
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) is located in Tennessee and North Carolina
and consists of nearly 521,000 acres. The park was established by Congress on June 15, 1934.
The parks mission is to protect, preserve, and interpret the natural, cultural, and historical
resources for the benefit and inspiration of present and future generations. There are over 9
million visitors annually. Control of non-native invasive species is a high priority in both
backcountry and boundary areas of the park in order to preserve the diversity of native flora and
fauna. In some boundary areas fuels reduction projects are taking place and non-native invasive
plant control is a part of that effort. Resource Management and Science personnel are tasked
with controlling non-native invasive species throughout the eight hundred square miles of park
property.
The purpose of this project is to accomplish the treatment of several large invasive exotic species
sites located in remote areas of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Some of these areas
are difficult to access and require large blocks of work time when Park personnel visit these sites.
The goal of this project is to accomplish a complete initial treatment and two re-treatments
(second year) of all indicated invasive exotic species at multiple separate work sites in the
Gatlinburg area. There are additional areas that may be added on to the contract if extra funds
become available and the contractor is willing to take on the additional work.

2. Required Services.
The purpose of this project is to eliminate invasive exotic plant species from areas of the Grea
Smoky Mountains National Park in the Gatlinburg area. The treatment areas are located on
boundary areas of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in and around Gatlinburg (see
attachment Area map and site maps). There are several work sites located in park boundary
areas where the park adjoins Gatlinburg city and/or private property. The work sites are remote
and will not be accessible by vehicles, although most areas have parking available nearby. All
areas are located in forested areas possibly near streams and wetlands.
The contractor shall provide all labor, tools, equipment, materials and supervision required to cu
and stump treat, as well as foliar spray invasive exotic plants within several areas near National
Park boundary and Gatlinburg. All of the appropriate exotic plant species will be treated
accordingly at each of the individual work sites. Work shall be completed over an 18 month
period from the date of award. One treatment shall be completed during the 2020 growing season
and two follow-up treatments shall be completed during the 2021 growing season.
The invasive exotic plant species that shall be treated fall into two groups:
•

Group #1
Mimosa (Albizia julibrissin)
Common privet (Ligustrum vulgare)
Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora)
1

All of the above listed species in group #1 are to be cut and immediately stump treated with the
appropriate herbicide mixture. Brush is to be consolidated and piled on site to the exten
necessary to facilitate immediate treatment with 25% triclopyr / 75% horticultural oil mixture with
red indicator dye on all stumps. Work sites are partially in stream corridors on steep ground and
varied terrain. All plants in wetland areas, in creeks, on creek banks, or within the mean high
water mark of streams will be treated with a solution of 25% glyphosate and 75% water with blue
indicator dye. Typical size of tree species ranges from 1/4 to 6 inches DBH with most being
sapling and seedling sized trees. The stem size of shrub species ranges from 1/8 to 5 inches
caliper at ground level. Seedlings of both tree and shrub species shorter than 8 inches tall and
smaller than 1/8 inch in caliper may be hand-pulled if necessary, as long as the entire root system
can be pulled out of the ground.
•

Group #2
Kudzu (Pueraria montana)
Oriental Bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus)
Japanese wisteria (Wisteria floribunda)
The vines species in Group #2 are to be cut and immediately stump treated with the appropriate
herbicide mixture of 25% triclopyr / 75% horticultural oil mixture with indicator dye on all stumps.
All kudzu vines growing into trees and shrubs must be cut and stump treated at ground level, as
well as cut several feet above the ground to prevent other vines from climbing back up. Brush is
o be consolidated and piled on site when necessary to facilitate the treatment of all stumps. All
plants in wetland areas, in creeks, on creek banks, or within the mean high water mark of streams
will be treated with a solution of 25% glyphosate and 75% water with indicator dye. After vines
are cut, the remaining ground cover of Kudzu shall be foliar sprayed with a 2% solution of
Triclopyr and water with appropriate surfactant. In streamside areas and wet or marshy areas a
solution of 2% glyphosate, labelled for aquatic use, and water shall be used.

For both plant groups:
•

Vegetation that has been cut must be removed from all roads and trails, or developed areas.
Treated vegetation must not pose a future hazard to Park visitors and must not have the potential
o fall into roads and trails, or campsites.

•

No treatments may take place during heavy rain or periods of surface run-off.

•

Actual conditions on the ground may vary. The work site encompasses several areas scattered
around the Gatlinburg, TN area (zip 37738).

•

All work areas have been affected by the Chimney Tops 2 wildfire event. There are many known
hazards associated with working in burned areas, including deep stump holes, dead standing
rees(snags), hanging limbs, downed trees, and partially fallen trees.

•

Listed below are descriptions of the separate work areas:

10. Special Contract Requirements
Archeological Findings
•

All work is subject to the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 CFR 1B, Archaeological Resources

http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/ch1B.html, or by contacting the COR.
Petroglyphs, artifacts, burial grounds or structural features, ceremonial, domestic and
archeological objects of any nature, historic or prehistoric, found in the work area are the
property of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and will only be removed by GRSM
Park personnel. Should the contractor’s operation uncover any archeological remains the
contractor will immediately suspend operations at the site of discovery, notify the COR of
he findings, and continue operations in other areas. Included in the notification will be a
brief statement describing the location (preferably with UTM coordinates located with
GPS technology) and a detailed description of the findings. Any archeological finding
MUST NOT BE DISTURBED IN ANY MANNER AFTER DISCOVERY to protect the
integrity of the site and preserve historic data. Should the temporary suspension of
work at the site result in delays, or the discovery site require archeological studies
resulting in delays or additional work for the contractor, he/she will be compensated by an
equitable adjustment under the General Provisions of the contract.

Pollutants such as fuels, lubricants, butamens, raw sewage, and/or other potentially
harmful materials will not be discharged onto the ground, into or near rivers, streams and
impoundments, or into natural or manmade channels. The vendor is responsible for all
clean up resulting from toxic spills and may be billed for costs of such cleanup if spills are
discovered after job completion that may be shown to have been the result of vendor
activities.
