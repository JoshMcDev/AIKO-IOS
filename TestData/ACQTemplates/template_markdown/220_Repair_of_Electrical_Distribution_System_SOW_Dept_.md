SCHEDULE OF COMPLETION

The Contractor shall develop, maintain, and submit for Government approval, a
project schedule identifying critical path events for all requirements to be
performed by the Contractor in accordance with (IAW) this Statement of Work
(SOW). The schedule shall include an event-driven schedule/network tha
includes all tasks (from project award through testing, training and close-out) and
logic necessary for the management of work, task flows, task interdependencies,
major milestones, key events and all deliverables required under the base contrac
and this SOW.

T

The Contractor’s project schedule shall include (not an all-inclusive list): unique
activity numbers, activity description, activity durations, baseline, actuals and
critical path. Furthermore, the Contractor shall identify tasks (i.e. submittal
reviews, testing, etc.) performed by the Government (unless otherwise stated, 21
calendar day Government review cycle) and delivery of products or information
provided by the Government on the project schedule.

REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall provide all necessary materials, software, training, labor,
supervision, and management to execute requirements.
Perform Electrical Energy Resilience Modeling for the Longare Electrical
Distribution Systems (LEDS) using existing annual 15 minute energy data
considering current backup assets (5 Existing Diesel Gensets) as well as to
consider economics and resilience of adding PV and Battery Energy Storage
Systems (BESSs).

The work shall be completed by 1 March 2022.

Field investigate existing conditions to determine condition and appropriate sizing
for existing and future capacity loads associated with energy resilience alternatives
being evaluated on the Longare Electrical Distribution System (LEDS). The inten
is to assess current condition of the LEDS, identifying any existing deficiencies
and determining what elements would be necessary to repair/replace/install to
create a ringed/resilient/redundant electrical infrastructure based upon the
modeling results to support an islandable Microgrid that would operate mission
critical loads in a cost-effective manner.
There are 5 Electrical Substations (ESSs) from the Utility Supplier Point of
Delivery (POD) for the LEDS which is currently laid out in two radial MV Feeds.
Each of the ESSs contain Medium Voltage Switches, Transformer and Low
Voltage Panel with multiple feeds and LV Breakers that supply the loads.
Appendix A shows the General Layout for the Longare/Site Pluto Line and

contains a single-line diagram/generator information for the LEDS.
