Contractor’s technical approach shall have the authority to respond to the solicitation. Your
presentation should answer 2 questions:

11.7 Page Limitations: Include page numbers on all documents. Non-price evaluation criterion is

Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluation report(s), DD Form 254,
Proof of Clearance, and Price are not subject to page limitations.
12.0 Evaluation and Award
The Contractor’s initial quote should contain the Contractor’s best technical terms and price. The
Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with one or more of the Contractor(s) if the
Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary.
All terms and conditions of contractor’s 03FAC/MAS contract shall apply to the resulting task
order. In responding to this RFQ, it is the Contractor’s responsibility to provide current, relevant,
complete, and accurate information in their quotation.
The Government reserves the right to incorporate elements of the quote into the awarded TO.
A TO will be awarded to the Contractor whose quote represents the best value to the Governmen
considering non-price and price factors. The Government may award to other than the lowest price
quote or other than the highest non-price factor rated quote. The non-price factors listed below are
of equal importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than price.
The non-price evaluation criterion is:
1: Technical Approach
2: Past Performance
12.1 Minimum Requirements:
Failure to comply with this minimum requirement will result in a “no-go” rating, and Contractor’s
quote will no longer be eligible for consideration.

provide proof of clearance with initial quote submission.
2) Contractor shall complete and submit Attachment 9, DD Form 254.

12.2 Non-Price Factors:
Page 8 of 13

GSA Project #:
Request for Quote
General Services Administration
Federal Acquisition Services
Rocky Mountain Region 8

Factor 1 – Technical Approach
Contractor shall submit a technical approach specifically addressing the following sub-factors:
Sub-factor A: Equipment Operation (to include water treatment)
Contractors shall provide the strategy or philosophy the company will employ to successfully
operate and maintain the data center as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).
The strategy should clearly describe, in sufficient detail, how the quoted solution will meet or
exceed the requirements of maintaining a TIA 942 tier 3/4 data center. The Contractor should
illustrate overall approach by using 2 examples; water treatment and a very specific equipmen
operation scenario.
Sub-factor B: Transition Staffing Plan
Contractor shall describe how full serviceability will be achieved by the performance start date,
including but not limited to reaching 90% to 100% staffing.
Basis of Evaluation:
The Government will evaluate the technical approach to determine:
(1) The extent the technical approach demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirements
as set forth in the PWS.
(2) The Contractor provided an equipment operation example and addressed water treatment.
(3) The degree to which the transition plan would render successful performance via a)
employment of qualified, certified personnel on-site by 1 October, 2020 b) staffing mix and
level of effort, and c) utilization of staff 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, onsite or offsite. A
more favorable rating will be applied to plans that can realistically reach 90 to 100% by
performance start date.
The transition staffing plan will be incorporated into the TO at time of award. The Contractor
is required to meet the qualification standards as originally proposed. If a Contractor is no
meeting the qualification standards then the CO may request consideration that considers the
hourly rate of the skill set as well as the length of time the qualification is not being met. The
CO will seek consideration by any means that are determined to be in the best interest of the
Government for the Contractor’s inability to successfully meet the qualification standards as se
forth in the task order PWS unless it was determined to be at the fault of the Government.
Security clearance processing is not considered an excusable delay, contractor shall provide
cleared personnel. If a quote provides qualifications exceeding the minimum qualifications and
results in a trade-off, the qualifications exceeding the minimum qualifications in the PWS will
become the new minimum qualifications and captured in the PWS at time of award.
Factor 2 – Past Performance
Contractor shall identify past performance as a contractor performing similar contract/subcontrac
or task order work within the last five (5) years prior to issuance of this solicitation. Contractor
shall submit no more than three (3) Past Performance evaluations or Past Performance
Questionnaires (PPQ’s). In order to be considered similar contract/subcontract or task order work,

option periods, and option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) for work identified in the
PWS. The Government will evaluate to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable and, if
necessary, realistic. Reasonableness will be determined by the labor mix, labor hours, and be
consistent with the technical approach, in that the prices are consistent with and reflect the
proposed staffing requirement for all years.
Government evaluation may consider other competitive prices received, the Independen
Government Estimate (IGE), and any other information the Contracting Officer deems useful at his
or her discretion.
