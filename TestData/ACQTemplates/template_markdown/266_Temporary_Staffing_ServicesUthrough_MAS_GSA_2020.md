Introduction to GSA MAS Temporary Staffing Services
Federal agencies often need interim solutions to
support mission-critical initiatives when key staff
members are unavailable for work because of illnesses,
emergencies, and family responsibilities. Within
Multiple Award Schedule (MAS), Temporary Staffing
Services – Special Item Number (SIN) 561320SBSA
– provides federal agencies with temporary-staff solutions, allowing
agencies to quickly respond to shifting priorities and changing
staffing requirements.
Whenever a federal agency procures services through MAS, the
emporary-help service contractor serves as the employer, maintaining
he relationship with the agency during the period its employees
support the client agency. As the employer, the contractor is
responsible for the human-capital and recruitment responsibilities and
oversees all human-resource functions, including recruiting, training,
compensation, and performance management of its employees.
