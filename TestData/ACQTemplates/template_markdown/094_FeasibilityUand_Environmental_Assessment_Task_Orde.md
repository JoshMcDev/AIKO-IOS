Leasing Furniture, Facts to Know
GSA Multiple Award Schedule, Special Provisions – Leasing Furniture
A lease is defined as a contract established for use of equipment or products, for
a specific length of time at an agreed monthly rate. Only items included under a
valid Multiple Award Schedule contract may be considered for leasing.
Agencies are advised to follow the guidance provided in the ​Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Subpart 7.4 Equipment Lease or Purchase​, and the Federal
Property Management Regulation (FPMR) 101-25.5, ​Guidelines for Making
Purchase or Lease Determinations​, in determining whether equipment should be
acquired by purchase or lease, as follows:
## EACH OFFEROR MUST SUBMIT ITS COMMERCIAL TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR LEASE RATES, CANCELLATIONS, AND BUYOUTS, SO
THEY CAN BE EVALUATED AND NEGOTIATED BY GSA.
A. Lease Types and Time Periods - ​The leasing program offered shall be
Lease-Purchase or Lease with Option to Purchase (Operating Lease). Each
order must specify the type of lease required. Unless the ordering office has
funding which exceeds a Government fiscal year, the initial term of the
leasing agreement is from the date of item acceptance through September 30
of the fiscal year in which the order is placed, with annual renewals for a total
possible lease term of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 years (the final renewal may be for a
partial year, to complete the period). In that regard, the Government, as
lessee, anticipates fulfilling the leasing agreement. The Government, upon
issuance of the delivery order, contemplates the use of the equipment for the
life of the lease (N months as specified in the delivery order). However,
renewal of a lease will be subject to availability of funding. Orders under the
lease shall not be deemed to obligate succeeding fiscal year’s funds or to
otherwise commit the government to a renewal. Under an Operating lease,
he term of the lease may not exceed 75 percent of the expected life of the
items, and the present value of payments may not exceed 90 percent of the
fair market value of the items.
B. Scope​ - The leasing programs shall be at least national in scope. Vendors
may offer leasing to cover only the United States, only for a particular country,
or worldwide.
C. User Orientation​ - The leasing programs shall contain provisions for user
orientation to assure maximum utility of the installation.

D. Add-On Items​ - The leasing programs must allow for add-on items which the
leasing agency can use to increase the number of items during the period of
he lease (basic plus renewals), if needed.
E. Buyout (Prepayment)​ - The leasing program shall contain a provision for
“buyout” (i.e., purchase of all leased items by the Government) at any time
during the lease, prior to the time for exercising the purchase. Offerors shall
submit with their offers any commercial practice terms or formulas used for
buyouts to be considered by the government. If the offeror has no commercial
practice for buyouts, or the submitted buyout terms are unacceptable to the
government, one will be negotiated into the contract.
F. Residual Value​ - Each leasing program should contain a provision for
residual value purchase of any or all the leased furniture at the conclusion of
he term of the lease. The residual value is a fixed percentage or dollar value,
and shall be specified on orders under resultant contracts, including orders
issued above the maximum order (MO). Residual value shall be mutually
agreed upon by the ordering agency and the contractor. All items no
purchased by the Government at the conclusion of the lease shall be
dismantled and removed from the Government premises by the contractor
within 90 days from expiration of the annual lease term, unless otherwise
agreed upon by the contracting officer in writing. Any costs for dismantling
and removal shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis between the
ordering agency and the contractor.
G. Scheduling of Work​ - Before installation is started, the contractors shall
arrange with the contracting office or his representative a means of access to
he premises, delivery and storage of materials and equipment, use of
approaches, corridors, stairways, elevators. Any requests received by the
contractor to change the sequence or scope of work shall be referred to the
contracting officer issuing the purchase order.
H. Additional Payment Terms​ - The contractor shall be paid in accordance with
he procedures of the Prompt Payment Act, except that Prompt Paymen
Discounts do not apply to monthly lease payments. The Prompt Payment Ac
(Public Law 97 – 177 (96 Stat. 85 31 USC 1801)), requires the submission of
proper information to be attached or included with the invoice. Bills for less
han one month shall be prorated at 1/30​th​ of the monthly rate for each
calendar day. Payments under this leasing provision shall be due on the 30​th
calendar day after the date of receipt of proper invoice in the governmen
office designated to receive invoices.
I. Title ​- Assignment of title by the contractor for any leased items will no
relieve the contractor of any responsibility of the contract.

J. Loss or Damage/Liability and Insurance​ - After acceptance, the
government shall be responsible for loss of or damage to leased items,
except for normal wear and tear and loss or damage caused by the
contractor, its agents, or employees. Should the government wish to have the
contractor be responsible for such loss or damage, this should be so stated in
he request for quote, and negotiated between the vendor and customer. The
contractor shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold the governmen
harmless against all actions or claims for loss of or damage to property or the
injury or death of persons resulting from the fault, negligence or wrongful ac
or omission of the contractor, its agents or employees. Further, the
contractors warrants that the contractor price includes no cost for insurance
or contingency to cover such actions or claims. Should the government pay
for any loss of damage pursuant to this paragraph, such payments shall no
exceed the amount of leasing appropriations available to the ordering agency
at the time of the loss. For any losses exceeding the amount of available
leasing appropriations, the procedures outlined in FAR Part 33 shall apply.
K. Reassignment of Leases and Options​ - Lease agreements herein may be
reassigned to another government activity. The assignee shall succeed to all
rights vested with the government including buyout or purchase option. The
lease program is not intended to cover the cost of any movement or
reconfiguration required as a result of a reassignment of lease agreements.
Any cost for movement or configuration occasioned by reassignment shall be
negotiated on a case-by-case basis between the ordering agency and the
contractor, outside the scope of the contract.
L. Termination of Lease​ - The Government reserves the right to terminate this
agreement, at any time, under the provision of “Termination for Convenience
of the Government”, FAR 52.212-4. Offerors shall submit with their offers any
commercial practice termination terms or formulas used to be considered by
he government. The early termination fee shall not exceed the difference
between the payments paid and what the payments would have been had the
lease been for the number of months at date of termination. The presen
value of the items, minus the residual value (if any), will be subtracted from
he amount due.
M. Annual Percentage Rates​ - The Annual Percentage Rates (APR) and lease
cost factors covered by this contract apply to leases not to exceed the
Maximum Order (MO), currently $500,000 (net purchase cost). For leases
over the MO, APR’s and lease cost factors are to be quoted on a
case-by-case basis in accordance with standard multiple award schedule
procedures. Residual cost percentages are fixed under each order, whether
net purchase cost is above or below the MO. For lease requirements under
he MO, the lease rate factor and corresponding APR are set, while the
residual value is to be mutually agreed upon. For lease requirements

exceeding the MO, the lease rate factor, corresponding APR, and the
residual values are all to be agreed upon. Requirements anticipated to
exceed the MO must include a requirement for responding vendors to provide
he lease rate factor, corresponding APR, and the residual value on the SF-18
or other documents issued for receipt of proposals. During evaluation of
leases, ordering agencies will be cautioned to verify that the quoted lease rate
factor corresponds to the annual percentage rate quoted. Verification may
require the use of a programmable financial calculator. For purposes of this
solicitation, the APR base will be the U.S. Government Securities, Treasury
Constant Maturities rate(s) which corresponds to the lease lengths (e.g.,
3-year, 5-year) under contract. The rates can be found a
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update/​. The “points” above this
rate to be allowed by GSA will be negotiated into the contract.
N. Design/Installation​ - Design or installation costs are not covered by the
lease provisions. Requirements for these services are to be negotiated on a
case-by-case basis and payment shall be handled under separate purchase
order/invoicing documents, and paid upon completion of the service.
O. Monthly Payments​ - Monthly payments under leases are normally calculated
using the Net purchase cost, residual value, and the lease rate factor on a
financial calculator or spreadsheet. The government will not pay the residual
value or interest twice. The lump sum residual value, if applicable, will be paid
at the end of the lease or whenever the buyout option is exercised to effec
ownership.
P. Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)​ - The lease rate for a particular order
shall be based on the U.S. Government Securities, Treasury Constan
Maturities rate(s) which corresponds to the lease lengths under contract, on
he date of quote to the customer. The rates can be found a
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update/​. Adjustments to the lease
rate of the contract may be made in accordance with clause 552.216-70,
except that the limit increase is not 10 percent. Contractors may request APR
base changes by providing documentation of the change in the U.S.
Government Securities, Treasury Constant Maturities rate(s) which
corresponds to the lease lengths under contract. The rates can be found a
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update/​. However, the
Government reserves the right to unilaterally adjust the Rate. Adjustments to
he lease rate of the contract may also be made in accordance with clause
552.216-70. Contractors may request changes to the lease rate not related to
changes in the base APR by submitting justification for such changes to the
contracting officer. Note that any EPA will apply only to new orders after the
effective date of the EPA. Once an order is placed, the rate will remain the
same for the entire lease period (3-year, 5-year, etc.).

Q. Uninterrupted Use​ - In recognition of the types of products on this Schedule
and the potential adverse impact to the Government’s mission, the
Government’s quiet and peaceful possession and unrestricted use of the
equipment shall not be disturbed in the event the equipment is sold by the
Contractor, or in the event of bankruptcy of the Contractor, corporate
dissolution of the Contractor, or other event, so long as the Government is no
in default. The equipment shall remain in the possession of the Governmen
until the expiration or government termination of the lease. Any assignment,
sale, bankruptcy, or other transfer of the leased equipment by the Contractor
will not relieve the Contractor of its obligations to the Government, and will no
change the Government’s duties or increase the burdens or risks imposed on
he Government.
R. Upgrades and Additions​ - While the title of the equipment remains with the
Contractor, the Government will not affix or install any accessory, addition,
upgrade, equipment or device on the items under any lease type without the
consent of the Contractor.
S. Third Parties​ - Third Party Leasing, which is allowed under this solicitation, is
defined as a leasing team arrangement in which the Third Party will act as a
financial source and take position as the primary contract holder. As the
Primary Contract Holder, the Third Party will have responsibility for billing
payments, and tracking Government sales information including the
submission of the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). When entering into a lease
arrangement with the agency, both the Third Party and Supplier mus
establish an agreement to define and designate the specific contracting
functions and responsibilities as required under the individual task order and
solicitation.
