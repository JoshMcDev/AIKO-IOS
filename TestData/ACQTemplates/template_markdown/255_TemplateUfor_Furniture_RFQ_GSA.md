2. Management Plan * If Required*
3. Delivery
* If Required*
4. Past Performance *For orders over simplified acquisition threshold*

size pages (excludes drawings). Anything over X pages will not be considered. Number the pages
consecutively and use an 11 point font size in an easily readable font, such as Times new Roman. The X page
limit shall be broken down as follows:

[Add any testing requirements if necessary. Contractors go through certain testing requirements to obtain a
GSA Schedule contract. Requesting contractors to re-submit the testing adds costs for the vendors]
FACTOR 2: MANAGEMENT PLAN *If Required*
Some suggestions on how to structure Management Plan Evaluation Criteria
The Management Plan shall address all of the following elements in order to be considered for further

hroughout the life of the BPA with minimal risk to the Government.

FACTOR 3: DELIVERY *If Required*
[Try to achieve an understating of the vendor’s ability to deliver the required products in time. The Narrative
