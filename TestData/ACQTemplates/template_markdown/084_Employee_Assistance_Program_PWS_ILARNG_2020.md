DOI-AAAP-0050 CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM
(DEC 2015)
a. FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The
Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting
System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be
conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15.
b. The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a webbased system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the repor
is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for
Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.
c. We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer (CO) with the name, position title, phone number,
and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s)
for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to
provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees
with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official (AO). Information in the repor
must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.
d. When your Contractor Representative(s) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically
generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training
information for CPARS is available at https://www.cpars.gov/.
e. Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the AO will complete an interim or final pas
performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at https://www.cpars.gov/.
1. Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the
evaluation without comment.
2. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the AO's narrative and should provide your views
on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.
3. All information provided should be reviewed for accuracy prior to submission.
4. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating No
comment in the space provided, and then selecting “Accept the Ratings and Close the Evaluation”.
5. Your response is due within 60 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR. On day 15, the evaluation
will become available in PPIRS-RC marked as “Pending” with or without comments and whether or not i

Page 14 of 36

NCAO ELEVATOR AND MAINTENANCE REPAIR SERVICES

has been closed.
6. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 60 days, it will automatically be returned to the
Government and will be annotated: -The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The
contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment.f. The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
1. Protect the evaluation as source selection information. After review, transmit the evaluation by
completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or
submit the form through CPARS, contact the CO for instructions.
2. Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never
released to persons or entities outside of your control.
3. Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, pre-award
surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.
g. If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the CO
no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or
via telephone or other means during your 60-day review period.
h. A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and
for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.

amended by related documents.
(b) Information Security Requirements.
(1) Sensitive Information. The term “sensitive information” means any information which warrants a
degree of protection and administrative control as defined by Reclamation or that meets the criteria for
exemption from public disclosure set forth under Sections 552 and 552a of Title 5, United States Code:
he Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. Sensitive information is generally categorized as
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information or CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED
INFORMATION (CUI), but in some cases may include other unclassified information. (The protection of
National Security information is beyond the scope of this clause. If any work on National Security
information is required under this contract, it is addressed under other contract clauses.) The Contractor
shall protect this type of information from unauthorized release into public domain, or to unauthorized
persons, organizations, or subcontractors. Information which, either alone or in aggregate, is deemed
sensitive by Reclamation shall be handled and protected in accordance with Reclamation directives and
standards for identifying and safeguarding sensitive information (SLE 02-01), which is available from the
COR or at http://www.usbr.gov/recman/DandS.html#sle.
(i) Any Government-furnished information or material does not become the property of the Contractor
and may be withdrawn at any time. Upon expiration or termination of the contract, all documents released
o the Contractor and any material created using data from such documents shall be returned to the COR
for final disposition. Government-furnished information residing on any electronic systems (laptops,
servers, desktops, media) shall be deleted from those systems using a COR-approved data erasure
solution. Only with prior authorization from the CO may the Contractor retain the material. The
Contractor or subcontractor shall not disclose or release the materials provided to the Contractor to any
individuals of the Contractor's organization not directly engaged in providing services under the contrac
or that do not have a valid need-to-know. All technical data provided to the Contractor by the
Government shall be protected from public or private disclosure in accordance with the markings printed
on them. All other information relating to the items to be delivered or the services to be performed under
his contract shall not be disclosed by any means without prior approval of the CO. Prohibited
dissemination or disclosure includes, but is not limited to: permitting access to such information by
foreign nationals or by immigrant aliens who may be employed by the Contractor, publication of
echnical or scientific papers, advertising, disclosure to Contractor staff not investigated and deemed
acceptable at the appropriate information sensitivity level, and any other public release. The Contractor
shall maintain, and furnish upon request of the CO, records of the names of individuals who have access
o sensitive material in its custody. All questions regarding information security, access, and control shall
be referred to the COR.
(ii) The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor’s organization any sensitive, or
otherwise protected information, regardless of medium in which it is contained (for example, film, tape,
document, electronic), pertaining to any part of this contract or any Reclamation program or activity,
unless the CO has given prior written approval. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases,
marketing promotions, articles, interviews, reports, social media posts, and any other media releases.
Requests for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, the

Page 19 of 36

NCAO ELEVATOR AND MAINTENANCE REPAIR SERVICES

purpose for the release, and a description of the need-to-know. The Contractor shall submit its request to
he CO ten business days before the proposed date for release. Subcontractors shall submit requests for
authorization to release through the prime Contractor to the CO.
(iii) The Contractor shall notify the COR immediately when known or suspected loss/compromise of
sensitive information or other documents, notes, drawings, sketches, reports, photographs, exposed film
or similar information which may affect the security interests of Government has occurred. This
requirement extends to employees and other personnel working on behalf of the Contractor, and expands
responsibility to include prompt reporting of security issues, including observed or subsequently
discovered efforts by unauthorized persons to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
(2) Classified Information.
(i) The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national
security. While this contract may not deal directly with classified information, each contractor is obligated
o protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information
echnology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is no
compromised.
(ii) Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites, or other
electronic or non-electronic media) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in
declassification of the documents. To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted
on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal
employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority.
Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c)
states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized
disclosure of identical or similar information." Although the Department has taken steps to prevent access
o publicly disclosed classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our
continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard.
(iii) Contractors (which include all employees of the contractor, as well as subcontractors and its
employees performing work for the contractor) are reminded of the following obligations with respect to
he treatment of classified information and the use of unclassified government information technology
systems:
(iv)The contractor shall not, while using unclassified Government computers or other devices (such as
phones or tablets) access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made
publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto
unclassified systems. This requirement does not restrict contractor access to unclassified, publicly
available news reports (and other unclassified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as
distinguished from access to underlying
documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are
available on public web sites or otherwise in the public domain).
(v) For contracts that require access to classified information, the contractor is responsible for obtaining
he required national security clearance through the Department of the Defense National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). Any classified contracts will be coordinated through the
Reclamation Chief Security Officer, or for IT requirements, the Bureau Chief Information Security
Officer. No contractor shall access classified information unless proper clearances have been obtained and
ransmitted to Reclamation. For further information, refer to 443 DM 1 or DOD NISPOM 5220.22-M
dated February 28, 2006 (incorporating change 2 dated May 18, 2016).
(vi) Classified information shall not be removed from official premises.
(vii) Classified information shall not be disclosed without proper authorization.
(c) Contractor Employee Suitability and Issuance of Government Identification Cards:

Page 20 of 36

NCAO ELEVATOR AND MAINTENANCE REPAIR SERVICES

(1) Performance of this contract requires Contractor personnel to have a Federal Government-issued
HSPD-12/FIPS-201-1 compliant Personal Identification Verification Card (PIV Card) before being
allowed unsupervised access to a Federally-controlled facility or information system. An active PIV Card
issued by another Federal Government agency will be accepted by Reclamation if the associated
background investigation is sufficient for the work and access to facilities and information systems
required under this contract, as determined solely by Reclamation. Physical access means routine,
unescorted or unmonitored access to non-public areas of a Federally-controlled facility. Logical access
means routine, unsupervised access to a Level 3 or 4 Federally controlled information system.
(2) At the Government’s sole discretion, the Government may issue a temporary identification card or
visitor identification badge, in lieu of a PIV Card, under one of the following conditions:
(i) The individual will only be associated with Reclamation for a period of 180 days or less, will not have
access to sensitive information, and any access to a sensitive area or Federal-controlled information
systems will be fully supervised. The 180 calendar day period begins on the first day of the individual’s
affiliation with Reclamation (in this case, the date that the individual’s contract performance begins) and
ends exactly 180 days later, regardless of the number of times the individual actually accesses a
Government facility or information system.
(ii) The individual will only have sporadic access to Federal facilities and information systems; will no
have access to sensitive information; and, any access to a sensitive area or Federal-controlled information
system will be fully supervised.
(iii) The individual will work exclusively outdoors, will not have access to sensitive information, and any
access to a sensitive area or Federal-controlled information system will be fully supervised.
(iv) In paragraphs (i) through (iii), supervised access means the individual’s access to, and movemen
within, a facility is monitored and controlled sufficiently to prevent access to any unauthorized areas,
equipment, or information; and the individual’s access to an information system is monitored and
controlled sufficiently to ensure appropriate use of the system and information, and to prevent access to
any unauthorized systems or information. Supervision must be performed by an individual with an active
Government-issued PIV Card.
(3) The Contractor shall furnish to the COR an alphabetical list of contract personnel, to include
subcontractors, who will require access to a Government facility or information system. The list shall
provide the full name, social security number, date of birth, place of birth, purpose or job title, and the
estimated duration of access. If the Contractor believes an individual should be issued a temporary
identification card or visitor identification badge in lieu of a PIV Card based on the conditions in
paragraph (4), then the Contractor must also submit a sufficient written justification as to why the specific
individual or individuals will not need a PIV Card. The Contractor shall provide this information before
he start of contract performance, or before the start of an individual’s performance when there is a
change or addition of personnel, with sufficient time to ensure that performance is not delayed by
compliance with credentialing processes.
(4) Any contract employees that will be issued a temporary identification card or visitor identification
badge, in lieu of a PIV Card, at the Government’s sole discretion, will be subject to the following
credentialing procedures:
[Insert any local identification card or visitor badge issuance procedures that will be used, such as those
used at the Denver Federal Center or in Federal Buildings.]
(5) Any contract employees that will be issued a PIV Card will be subject to the following credentialing
procedures:
(i) The Government will initiate the e-Qip electronic background investigation process, and give the
Contractor instructions for completing the background investigation and PIV Card process. As part of the
PIV Card process, each Contractor employee shall be required to appear in person at a Government PIV

Page 21 of 36

NCAO ELEVATOR AND MAINTENANCE REPAIR SERVICES

Enrollment Station to have personal identity verification documents verified, have a photograph taken, be
fingerprinted, and to pick up and activate the PIV Card when completed. The Contractor must make its
personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate this process.
(ii) At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor must identify all contractor
and subcontractor personnel who will require (insert as appropriate physical and/or logical) access for
performance of work under this contract. The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place
and time specified by the COR or DOI Access Card Sponsor in order to initiate screening and background
investigations. The following electronic forms, or their equivalent, shall be used to initiate the
credentialing process:
(a) OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P
(b) OF 306
(c) Release to Obtain Credit Information
(d) Fingerprint Card FD-258 or electronic fingerprints (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to
be done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the Contractor).
(iii) The cost of completing the above processes and submitting the above forms, including any charges
for obtaining fingerprints and traveling to a Credentialing Center for card
enrollment and activation, shall be borne by the Contractor. The cost of suitability and PIV-related
background investigations shall be borne by Reclamation. For contracts that require a national security
clearance, the cost of obtaining the national security clearance, including any associated background
investigation, will be borne by the Contractor.
(iv) Contractor employees are required to complete all forms and to give, and to authorize others to give,
full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability
determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds
for denial or revocation of credentials. Government personnel may contact the Contractor personnel being
investigated in person, by telephone, or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for
such contact.
(v) For each Contractor employee that will be issued a PIV Card, the Government will conduct a
background investigation. The tier level of background investigation for each Contractor employee will
be determined by the Government based on the risk and sensitivity levels as described in Reclamation’s
“Personnel Security and Suitability Directives and Standards,” SLE 01-01, which is available a
http://www.usbr.gov/recman/DandS.html#sle. At a minimum, each Contractor employee that will be
issued a PIV Card will receive a Tier 1 [previously a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries
(NACI)] Background Investigation. The minimum standards which will be used in suitability
determinations are contained in the DOI Departmental Manual Part 441, Chapter 5, which is available a
http://elips.doi.gov/ELIPS/DocView.aspx?id=3858.
(vi) Each Contractor employee in a position designated as higher than Low Risk Non-Sensitive shall be
reinvestigated on a periodic basis as described in Reclamation’s Personnel Security and Suitability
Directives and Standards. A reinvestigation may also be initiated when the Contractor or the Governmen
believes that a particular individual’s continued ability to meet the contract’s minimum standards is in
question; or if it is determined that the position has changed and a higher level investigation is warranted.
(vii) If a Contractor employee has worked under a Federal agency contract within the past two years, and
hat contract required a successfully-adjudicated background investigation at the same risk level as (or
higher than) this contract, further investigation may not be necessary. The Contractor shall provide the
COR with documentation that supports the individual’s previous contract work and any information,
including name and social security number, date of birth, and place of birth, needed for Governmen
verification of previous background investigation.
(viii) Contractor employees who have been successfully adjudicated will be issued DOI Access Cards,

Page 22 of 36

NCAO ELEVATOR AND MAINTENANCE REPAIR SERVICES

which must be activated at a USAccess Credentialing Center.
(ix) If the final adjudication is unfavorable on a Contractor employee, or if Reclamation finds a
Contractor employee to be unsuitable or unfit for his or her assigned duties, the CO will direct the
Contractor to remove the individual from the contract and access to the Federal facility at which the
contract activities are occurring. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the
Government concerning the suitability of a particular employee to perform work under this contract, the
Government shall have the right of final determination. Determinations under this requirement are subjec
o the Disputes Clause. Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause could
constitute grounds for termination for default.
(x) Reclamation will not allow a Contractor employee access to their investigation files. An individual
may request, under the provisions of the Privacy Act and/or Freedom of Information Act, copies of their
files from the investigative agency (Office of Personnel Management). Reclamation will not release a
copy of any investigative file, in whole or part, to the Contractor or any Contractor representative.
(xi) During performance of the contract, the Contractor must keep the COR apprised of changes in
personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes. Cards
hat have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours.
If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it must be coordinated through the COR.
(xii) At the end of the contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under
his contract, the Contractor must ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR.
