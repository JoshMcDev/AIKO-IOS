STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO), BPA
Comprehensive Digital Records Managemen
1.1

INTRODUCTION

The [Insert Agency Name] and its mission area are pursuing the acquisition of comprehensive digital
records management solutions with the objectives of replacing manual, paper-based business
processes. [Insert Agency Name] is seeking solutions that provide capabilities for scanning and
managing records, both permanent and temporary, end-to-end across the full lifecycle with
NARA-compliant electronic records.
This Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the goals that [Insert Agency Name] expects to achieve
with regard to the implementation of comprehensive digital records management capabilities. The
solutions under this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) are expected to improve business performance
by providing [Insert Agency Name] users with new electronic records capabilities reflecting curren
industry offerings.
Ultimately, the solutions provided under this BPA will meet industry performance standards, offer the
necessary extensibility and scalability to meet [Insert Agency Name] needs, provide state-of-the-ar
echnology that promotes a rich user experience and facilitates user adoption while avoiding service
disruption to the maximum practical extent.
1.2

PURPOSE: ​This BPA is being established under the FSS in accordance with FAR part 8.4. A
single-award BPA is envisioned against which Calls can be issued on a Firm fixed priced (FFP),
Time & Materials (T&M), and Labor Hour (LH) basis. The Government anticipates issuing a
series of BPA Calls that will leverage and successively build upon outcomes and achievements
hat occur as [Insert Agency Name] matures its digital records management capabilities.
Work shall be
performed in accordance with this agreement and the successful awardee’s underlying GSA
Schedule(s).

1.3

DURATION: ​The period of performance for this BPA will be for 5-years from date of award,
unless the BPA is cancelled or expires. A BPA expires when the Contractor’s GSA Schedule which
he BPA is predicated upon, expires.

1.4

OVERARCHING BENEFITS AND CHANGE DRIVERS​:

● Improved Customer Experience: ​Improve customer experience by providing a single source of
customer documents across programs and agencies

● Compliance: ​OMB Memorandum M-19-21 sets new targets for all agencies to convert all

permanent federal records to electronic forms with appropriate metadata. By the end of CY2019 all
permanent records must be managed in electronic format. By the end of CY2022, all permanen
records must be managed in electronic format with appropriate metadata; the National Archives
and Records Administration (NARA) will stop accepting paper records on that date.

● Employee Productivity: ​Electronic documentation improves staff efficiency and effectiveness to
provide better customer service.

● Potential Cost Savings: ​Transition/migration to electronic document management requires
significant investment. Expected savings can offset the upfront investment over time.

2.1

SCOPE

The scope of this BPA includes all document management and support services required to scan, tag,
support SEO, store, access, control and manage digital records along with all necessary technical services
o acquire, design, test, implement, secure, operate, and maintain a comprehensive Digital Records
Management System (DRMS) with effective internal controls to secure and safeguard electronic records.
The scope includes:
●

Paper-to-Electronic Record Conversion: ​Scanning, analyzing, indexing, quality checking, and
storing existing paper records as electronic artifacts.

●

Indexing and Searching Engine: ​Enables indexing and searching of stored e-records by managing
metadata about the records. This is the central engine that controls access and life cycle for all
he managed artifacts governed by established policies and procedures.

●

Records Management: ​Full lifecycle management support of electronic records in accordance
with Federal and agency records management standards and rules.

●

Security & Business Rules: ​Access controls applied universally to protect data and enforce
business policies. Business rules leveraged by all components to ensure consistency,
completeness, and accuracy of metadata.

●

Extensible: ​In the future, other systems (using APIs) should be able to read, write, manage and
access records to the provided solution of this BPA.

2.2
## RECORDS MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Within ​Attachment 01,​ the Government has identified the set of reference standards, regulations, and
policies that are relevant to and govern the management of records by federal agencies. The lates
edition of such will apply to work performed under this BPA.
Attachment 01 Records Managemen

2.3
RECORDS LIST, UNIVERSAL ERM REQUIREMENTS, FILE MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSITION
[Insert Agency Name] has developed a spreadsheet that describes the applicable Universal ERM
Requirements (​Attachment 02​). For reference, [Insert Agency Name] has developed a spreadsheet tha
frames the File Plans for NRCS and FSA and lists the descriptions, the disposition, and the disposition
authorities applicable to the
various records types within these agencies (Records List, ​Attachment 03​). This is a living document tha
is expected to change.

For reference, the Government has included within ​Attachment 04​, the NRCS DMS Release 5 Document
Type Reference; and within ​Attachment 05​, the FSA File Maintenance and Disposition Manual.

2.4
## REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE
[Insert Agency Name] has provided a reference architecture that frames the current and desired
future-state capabilities for the DRMS. The DRMS Reference Architecture (​Attachment 06​) frames the
envisioned
arget state capabilities and will serve as a basis to support the procurement of design and
implementation services to establish DRMS and fulfill comprehensive digital management needs
under this BPA.

The first call under this BPA, as detailed in the Call 1 SOO (​Enclosure 3​), includes a pilot for the
digitization of records at 15 discrete service center locations and the buildout of the DRMS Middleware
with APIs that are necessary to provide the underlying functionality for this initiative. It is anticipated
hat subsequent BPA Calls will build upon lessons learned and outcomes from this pilot.
The pilot will occur concurrently with the development of the DRMS Middleware and must leverage the
existing FMI-DMS for pilot document/record storage. Lessons learned from the pilot will help perfec
he ultimate development and configuration of the DRMS Middleware deployed to the targe
production infrastructure. Inevitability, the FMI-DMS will become a subordinate storage system utilized
by the DRMS Middleware. This relationship between the DRMS Middleware with dependent systems,
mission delivery applications, and subordinate commercial storage systems is explained within the
Reference Architecture.
2.5

CROSS-MAPPING REQUIREMENTS TO THE REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE
The matrices provide the Contractor with a mapping of requirements to related sections in the Agency DRMS

providing additional context behind the government’s current thoughts about long term need. Because the
reference describes an envisioned long-range target state, the mappings of the current phase-oriented
implementation architecture requirements are not one-to-one. Nevertheless, understanding long term goals can
help the Contractor propose and justify implementation choices that will better support incremental evolution
oward the desired future.
