1.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.
1.1 Scope. This Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) describes the services required for
replacement and sustainment of the AFRC Command Post (CP) Command and Control
Advanced Console Systems (ACS). The scope includes removal of old systems, installation
of new systems, preventative maintenance, and sustainment of the new consoles located a
19 reserve sites (HQ AFRC, nine AFRC host bases and ten tenant bases). ACS consoles are
currently employed in AFRC CP, Alt. CP, FD, and SF facilities at these locations listed in
Table-1 below.

Command Post: The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)/A3 needs to standardize a
echnical solution for Command & Control (C2) capabilities to replace End of Life (EOL)
console communications systems at AFRC Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), tenant Wings, and
dispatch centers throughout the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The AFRC
organization with primary responsibility for this requirement is HQ AFRC Directorate of
Communications (A6X), Plans & Programs Division. The replacement communication
system must meet the AFMAN 10-207, paragraph 5.3.4 – 5.3.5 standard which states
“Command Posts will have Telephones or Communications Consoles. The telephones or
communication consoles must meet requirements outlined in DoDI 8100.04. DoD Unified
Capabilities. All systems must comply with Telecommunications Electronics Material
Protected from Emanating Spurious Transmissions in accordance with AFI 33-200, Cyber
Security Program Management and AFSSI 7700, Emission Security. All telephone handsets
within the Emergency Actions/Console area, to include any collocated agencies (e.g., Air
Terminal Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center, Emergency Operations
Center) must have a push-to-talk feature installed. Command Posts will have HighFrequency/Ultra High-Frequency/Very-High-Frequency Radio (at least one of the three).
High-Frequency/Ultra High-Frequency/Very-High-Frequency radios are used to
communicate directly with aircraft and mission essential personnel. At a minimum, all
Command Posts, regardless of installation mission/configuration should have an Ultra HighFrequency radio, to facilitate Command and Control with aircraft transiting their area. All
Command Posts and Specialized Command and Control Elements with Ultra HighFrequency Radio capabilities/responsibilities will maintain AFI 11-418, Operations
Supervision, and have a Conference Hotel Quick Reaction Checklist. ”
The contractor will include an Authority to Operate (ATO) prior to connection to the Air
Force Network (AFNet). If no ATO exists contractor will provide POC who will provide all
system artifacts required for securing ATO for connection to the AFNet. If system software
is IA-enabled (product or technology whose primary role is not security, but which provides
security services as an associated feature of its intended operating capabilities), it must be
National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) certified. Contractor personnel
2

performing maintenance support shall meet DoDD 8570.1 Certification Information
Assurance Technical Level-II certification. The system will include a Voice over Interne
Protocol (VoIP) capable system which includes a redundant communications server with
redundant power supplies and hot-redundant LAN interfaces. The system will include a
VoIP capable dispatch capability, crisis management dispatch consoles, and other associated
elecommunications hardware and software. Command Post C2 switches must provide for
rapid and assured selection of radios, telephone systems, direct lines, remote controls, and
voice recording capability. They must also provide for ground-to-air, radio-to-wire phone
patch, and conference calls. The VoIP upgrade solution provides required services, smaller
hardware footprint, redundancy/survivability and lowers future sustainment costs.
Security Forces: The Base Defense Operations Centers (BDOC) at our nine BOS locations
will have three workstation configurations with touch screen user interface and multi-line
phone system at each station. Push-to-talk handsets/headsets consisting of shielded, twistedpair cabling to enhance emissions security. Must include capability of monitoring
elephonic/radio communication of all workstations. Each handset/headset configuration
have capability to manage five or more calls from touch-screen. Each workstation will have
conference call capability with “drag and drop”, break-in, add, transfer or delete callers.
Fully integrated into the Giant Voice Systems and EMNS systems where applicable via
ouchscreen and multi-line telephone system. Visual message waiting indicators (phones)
multiple programmable phone ring alerts. Transfer of incoming calls to secure voice system
with integrated voice logging system (landline & radio), caller name/number caller ID, and
redial last number, call transfer/forwarding and call history. Programmable keys/buttons
form touch-screen with telephone directory able to maintain a minimum of 1,000 numbers.
BDOC will have integrated High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency/Very high Frequency
capability.
Fire Emergency Service (FES): Base Operation Support (BOS) FD Emergency
Communications Center (ECC) dispatcher workstations must provide emergency response
command & control (C2) capabilities IAW National Incident Management System (NIMS)
directive (directive?) for communications and clear text interoperability. To include but no
limited interoperability with installation-level command post, security forces, aircraf
maintenance operations control center, and aircraft control tower mission partners.
Additionally BOS FD ECCs are required to maintain C2 interoperability with off-base local
community hospital medical control centers, first responder agencies, and/or FD mutual aid
partners. Equally important, due to installation-level non-organic AFRC medical response
capabilities - our BOS FDs delivery emergency medical services (EMS) at the EMT-B level.
