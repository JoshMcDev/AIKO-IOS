REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
Laminate Casegoods
This is a RFI, SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, issued by ___________________________________seeking information from
prospective vendors interested in providing Laminate Casegoods
A procurement may result in a Blanket Purchase Agreement award according to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4
Federal Supply Schedules, under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule.
NAICS Code (North American Industry Classification System) 337214 applies to this RFI.
NAICS 337214: Office Furniture (Except Wood) Manufacturing, Business Size: 500 employees
At this time, the government intends to set-aside the procurement for a total small business set aside in accordance with FAR
52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside. Only quotes submitted by small business concerns under the applicable
NAICS Code, 337214, will be accepted by the Government. Any quote that is submitted by a contractor that is not a small
business concern will not be considered for award. Additionally, if the procurement is set-aside, the Non-Manufacturing Rule
(NMR) will apply. The NMR requires that a small business performing under a set-aside order MUST provide the products of
small business domestic manufacturers. Any quote that reflects products of large business manufacturers will not be
considered for award.
Note: NAICS Code 337214 must be added to all quoter’s System for Award Management (SAM) record (https://www.sam.gov)
o be eligible to submit a quote for the formal Request for Quote (RFQ) which will be posted in the future.
Product specifications for these furniture products are located in the attached document, Item Purchase Description (IPD) for
Laminate Casegoods, 3QSA-17-628.
Please note that any or all commodities herein are being routinely considered for a Strategic Sourcing Solution, which may
result in cancellation of any or all commodities herein, or may result in the addition of commodities within the awarded produc
line(s).
The Request for Quote (RFQ) will be posted on GSA eBuy (https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/).
The basis of award will be “lowest price technically acceptable”. Submitted pricing quotes must be FOB Destination, inclusive
of shipping. The Government is requesting GSA Multiple Award Schedule pricing or better.
This BPA will be awarded against the successful quoter’s current GSA schedule contract. In the event the current GSA
schedule contract reaches Evergreen expiration and a successor GSA schedule contract is awarded, this BPA shall
automatically transfer to the successor GSA schedule contract, under the conditions that the successor schedule contrac
includes those items awarded under the BPA and that the vendor honors the lower of the BPA prices or the new MAS price
adjusted for any BPA discount.
It is anticipated that the RFQ will include the following technical factors:
(1) Compliance with technical characteristics
(2) Past Performance
The specific evaluation factors will be fully described in the RFQ.

PLEASE NOTE: FAR 15 DOES NOT APPLY
The Government intends to establish a BPA upon initial quotes received without further communicating with contractors.
Consequently, contractors are highly encouraged to quote their best technical and pricing quotes in their initial submissions.
However, the Government reserves the right to communicate with any or all contractors submitting a technical and price
quote, if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. This statement is not to be construed to mean that the
Government is obligated to communicate with every quoter (note that FAR Part 15 procedures do not apply to FSS orders,
herefore formal discussions are not applicable). A contractor may be eliminated from consideration without further
communication if its technical and/or pricing quotes are not among those contractors considered most advantageous to the
Government.
## THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION
This is a notice for sources sought, and is intended to compile a list of companies interested in receiving the formal
Request for Quote (RFQ). Quoted pricing is not required at this time. The information provided in this document is
subject to change and is not binding on the Government. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation
on the part of the Government to procure supplies or to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no
obligation to pay direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to
his notice or the Government’s use of such information.
