Supporting this responsibility, the Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (OTIA) has
been charged with implementing a comprehensive multi-year plan to facilitate securing the U.S.
borders and reducing illegal migration. The OTIA Program Management Office (PMO) is
charged with acquiring, fielding, testing, and sustaining layered technical capabilities to achieve
improved situational awareness along the U.S. border. Our customers are the agents and officers
of CBP the Office of Border Patrol (OBP), the Office of Field Operations (OFO), and the Office
of Air and Marine (OAM).

As a part of its assignment, OTIA is to pursue an upgrade of the existing Remote Video
Surveillance System (RVSS) deployed in Arizona, with options to deploy additional systems in
he Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector. This project is identified as the “RVSS Upgrade Program.”

The United States Border Patrol currently employs the RVSS as its persistent wide area
day/night motion imagery surveillance and monitoring capability in protecting the U.S. borders
from illegal incursions and activities. Located on dedicated elevated fixed towers or tall
structures, RVSS cameras provide the persistent ground surveillance capability needed by Border
Patrol Agents (BPA) to effectively deter, detect, track, identify, classify, and respond to Items of
Interests (IoI) located along the U.S. borders. While current or legacy RVSS equipment have
performed relatively well, gaps have been identified in areas of effectiveness and suitability, as
well as technology obsolescence, limited vendor support, and the end-of-useful life of many
RVSS subsystems.

The Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) procurement is one element of a broader CBP
strategy to rapidly acquire non-developmental (and ideally commercially available) systems to
support border enforcement efforts. Technology combines with other resources and capabilities;
notably personnel, infrastructure, and intelligence; to improve the overall efficiency and
effectiveness of our border enforcement efforts.

32

35

The current strategy for the acquisition and deployment of technology derives from lessons
learned from past experience. Most notably, the recent effort to develop and deploy a system
known as the Secure Border Initiative-network (SBInet) provided key insights about CBP’s pas
approaches. Among other things, the SBInet experience taught us:

x Industry (often in response to military needs) appears to have already available many
systems that could provide the type of capabilities offered by at least portions of SBInet,
although they may not meet all of the aspirations for SBInet.

39
40

x Quantitative analysis on the benefits of technology for border enforcement is extremely
limited. Nonetheless, Border Patrol experience to date provides compelling evidence tha

As a component of the United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs
and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for protecting our Nation’s borders in order to
prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the U.S. while facilitating the flow of
legitimate trade and travel. CBP is also responsible for apprehending individuals attempting to
enter the U.S. illegally.

technology is useful in (1) detecting incursions across the border, (2) identifying or
classifying those incursions, (3) providing more efficient application of personnel to
respond to incursions, and (4) enhancing agent safety through increased awareness of each
actical situation. Technology also offers opportunities to measure the amount of crossborder traffic and changes in that traffic over time. The Border Patrol primarily uses
echnology for detection and surveillance between ports of entry, enabling CBP to
maximize its effectiveness in responding to and disrupting illicit activity. In other words,
echnology enhances situational awareness of the amount and types of illegal activity a
he border, enabling officers to spend more of their time responding to incursions and less
of their time detecting them.

51
52
53

The RVSS systems that are the subject of this procurement are part of the overall Arizona plan.
Offerors should understand this solicitation within the overall context of CBP’s plan for
echnology.

First and foremost, CBP is NOT interested in any kind of a system development. CBP
understands it is unlikely that there are existing (non-developmental) systems that meet ALL of
its aspirations and desires. Instead, CBP is interested in selecting a non-developmental (and
preferably commercially available) system that represents the best mix of capabilities. CBP has
prepared a Functional Specifications Document that includes both thresholds and objectives for a
variety of performance parameters. CBP is providing this information so that offerors may have
a better understanding of the totality of characteristics that CBP values in a system. There will be
a few Critical Performance Parameters that the system must meet. However, except as described
elsewhere in this solicitation, CBP is willing to forego lower priority parameter performance
(even at the threshold level) where the overall value of the total system outweighs missing lower
priority parameters. Offerors who cannot meet some lower priority parameters, but otherwise
offer good performance and high confidence at an attractive price, should expect to compete
favorably in this procurement. Offerors who offer higher performance at a higher price should
also expect to compete favorably if the increased performance is worth the marginal increase in
price. CBP is interested in selecting from among a wide range of offerings, trading combinations
of performance against price. CBP also values the participation of small businesses and will give
more weight to offerors who make extensive use of small businesses, assuming those small
businesses have the capacity to succeed with low risk to the Government. In all cases, CBP will
seek strong confirmation that each offeror’s system is truly non-developmental. Offerors mus
provide strong assurance that the proposed system is now ready, deployable and will not require
additional engineering development effort if they hope to receive favorable consideration.

75
76

The Government has conducted extensive market research and has high confidence that there are
currently existing, non-developmental systems that will warrant an eventual contract award
under this solicitation. However, if the Government concludes there are no offerors who provide
adequate confidence in the non-developmental nature of their providers, or no offerors who
provide enough performance at reasonable cost, CBP will cancel the solicitation altogether rather
han procure an ineffective or high risk offering.

81
82
83
84

The ultimate contract requirements will be the specifications, capabilities and performance
proposed by the successful offeror. Offerors who fail to meet the performance levels they
hemselves propose should not expect tolerance from the Government. All offerors are on notice
hat the Government will be ready, willing, and able to terminate for default any successful

Offeror’s should be aware that CBP expects to gain important experience through deployment
and operation of its technology systems. These immediate procurements will provide a sort of
echnology baseline of which CBP can assess the value of potential enhancements in the future.
Operation of the non-developmental systems will also enable CBP to collect data about the
effectiveness of technology. These data, in turn, will assist CBP in building quantitative models
o advise future technology procurement strategies.

Put another way, CBP has not forsaken technology development and improvement. CBP remains
very interested in gaining increased capability and value from technology in the future. Bu
echnology development is NOT an interest for the systems, which are the subject of this instan
solicitation. Instead, this procurement, along with the other technology elements of our Arizona
plan, will form the comprehensive technology baseline of which we will establish the
requirements and relative values for future technology. That future technology will be a concern
for future procurement activities—not this one.

General Dynamics’ proposal includes a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the proposed
echnology solution (system) to expand USBP’s surveillance capabilities in accordance with the
Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan and RVSS Operational Scenarios with our RVSS
Upgrade proposal. The approach highlighted the expansion of surveillance capabilities that will
be achieved through the deployment of existing, proven technology solutions tailored to the
unique operational constraints along the border. We believe General Dynamics’ solution reflects
a complete and comprehensive understanding of USBP mission, including considerations of how
echnology will be used in the operational environment, “user friendliness,” vulnerability to
environment and threats. Our CONOPS shall be coordinated and fine-tuned with CBP
hroughout the development process. This CONOPS is flexible enough to provide you an
enhanced customer experience and can be used across all AoRs.

Approach
Average time between failures; typically includes all failures
without regard to any fault tolerance that may exist.
Used when redundancy exists in a system. It is often used to
differentiate system reliability from series mean time between
failure (MTBF).
Sum of Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) and Mean Logistics
Down Time (MLDT).
The percentage of time that a system will be available to
perform its operational functions; AO = (Mission Capable
Time) / (Total Time). To determine how to increase
availability, the components of Total Time (i.e., up time plus
down time) must be quantified. Up time is simply Mission
Capable Time or Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM).
Down time is the sum of MTTR and MLDT (Mean Logistics
Down Time). Therefore, the formula for predicting AO can be
written as AO = (MTBM) / (MTBM+MTTR+MLDT) =
(MTBM) / (MTBM + MDT).

4.18.1. AO Exclusions
General Dynamics shall not be held responsible for the Contractor’s contribution to the
Operational Availability (AO) formula under this contract due to causes beyond the control of the
Contractor. Examples of such causes include:
x
x
x
x

Interference of preventative and/or corrective maintenance activities due to night time
failures, or unsafe working conditions due to unusually severe weather or adverse access
road conditions.
Vandalism, Intentional Maliciousness, and other types of catastrophic damage due to
external sources.
Interference of preventative and/or corrective maintenance activities caused by Custom &
Border Protection direction due to high risk operations in the area.
Force Majeure such as Natural Disasters or lightning strikes.

4.18.2. Failure Definitions and AO Reporting
The CBP failure prioritization model includes three levels: Priority 1 (P1), Priority 2 (P2), and
Priority 3 (P3). General Dynamics shall use the following definitions for priority to clarify how
failures experienced by the deployed system should be counted for calculating AO:
x

Priority 1 is a failure of the system’s primary functions and/or any safety related issue.
Priority 1 failures are all counted as system failures/downtime in the Ao calculations.
Examples of Priority 1 failures include:

o Any failure of a mission critical sensor or PTU (mission critical sensor defined as
any day or Infrared cameras). Software restarts for mission critical sensors (both
commanded and un-commanded) will be included in downtime for AO
calculations.
o Failure of a communications package impacting the ability of the user to receive
sensor data, or causes a degradation of sensor controls.
o Failure of a DAQ, VMS, Domain Control Server, Secondary Display Server,
Video Record Archive Server, Microsoft System Center Server, or any system
degradation that inhibits users from achieving mission operations.
o Loss of multiple C2 user workstations; no less than 75% of user workstations
shall be operational at any given time in each AOR.
o Failure of the SOC workstation or security functions.
o Loss of operational use of more than one Secondary Display Monitor per
Secondary Display Server. Exception where specific AOR has only 6 monitors or
less (i.e. Ajo Papago Farms). With this exception, loss of one display would be
considered a Priority 1 failure.
o Any condition preventing a C2 user from logging into or using a workstation.

Priority 2 is a partial failure or degradation of primary system functions that impact
primary functionality but mission operations are achievable with alternative methods (i.e.
work-around solution). Repair of a Priority 2 failure may induce a Priority 1 failure
during the repair which will then be counted in the downtime for calculating AO. A
Priority 2 failure may escalate to a Priority 1 failure if the redundant capability fails and
causes a failure of a primary system function. Priority 2 failures do not affect the
calculated Ao unless they induce a Priority 1 failure. Examples of Priority 2 failures
include:
o Loss of a single monitor at an individual C2 user workstation.
o Loss of Laser Illuminator capability.
o Loss of NOC workstation.

is available to enable operations to continue would be considered a Priority 3 failure.
These failures do not have any effect on the calculated AO. Examples of Priority 3
failures include:
o Loss of a single Secondary Display Monitor.
o Loss of loud hailer capability.
o Loss of the spotlight capability.

The Communications topology or “lay-down” is designed to ensure that the network continues to
function in the presence of single points of failure by utilizing a ring architecture. Although no
required to meet the communications system availability (see Section D1.3.2) requirement, we
have included Hot Standby (HSB) radios. Should the requirement for HSB radios be removed, a
1+0 radio configuration may be used in conjunction with a ring topology where HSB radios are
only used on spur sites. Upon completion of the link design in Pathloss, site surveys shall be
performed where Line-of-Sight (LOS) is verified and antenna heights are determined. Link
budget calculations shall be finalized to include antenna sizes, transmit power, and radio
parameters such as frequency and modulation. Path verification using tower climbs and link
flashing may have to take place if the survey cannot establish LOS.

The deployment of RVSS equipment includes upgrading existing capabilities as well as
installing sensors on new towers along the southern border. USBP uses the existing RVSS
system 24 hours a day for operational use in border surveillance. This existing capability
provides the Border Patrol with detection and monitoring of United States border. It is the
Government’s goal to minimize the impact to USBP operations by avoiding the loss of existing
sensor functionality to the maximum extent possible while the deployment of new sensor
equipment and C2 facility is in progress. The Government desires to allow “early operations”
whereby the Border Patrol agents will utilize the complete/partial system when field deploymen
work; maintenance or testing is not being performed on the system. It is recognized that the early
operations will require close coordination to ensure there is no impact to the technology
deployment and installation while accommodating the operational needs of USBP. During ‘early
operations” General Dynamics will provide the same level of accountability (including
configuration control, fault identification and documentation) and support to the USBP agents as
hey would if their own personnel were using the system. Onsite technical and operational
support personnel knowledgeable in the operation of the system will support the operators by
answering questions, providing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to perform specific system
functions, capturing system issues and system feedback.

Deliverables and Deliverable Schedule:

Requirements List (CDRL) and Associated Data Item Descriptions (DID).

6.1.
Early Operations and RVSS System Usage Expanded
General Dynamics fully understands USBP’s operation and the importance of that operation
continuing 24 hours a day 7 days a week. We shall support and work all upgrades as well as new
installations insuring minimum impact to the ongoing operations. Equipment shall be installed in
an expeditious manner and all action with be pre-coordinated with CBP personnel. We suppor
CBP’s early operations concept and as soon as equipment and functions have been installed and
appropriately tested in accordance with agreed-to test procedures, operations may begin on tha
equipment. Our engineering staff and on-site installation crews shall provide hands on training to
facilitate early operations. Close coordination and communication will be the key to the success
of the new RVSS installation process with little or no disruptions to CBP’s critical ongoing
operations.

General Dynamics Deployment Strategy for Nogales
Deployment of the RVSS Upgrade in the existing AoRs in Arizona requires careful planning and
coordination in order to avoid any extended outages for existing RVSS Sensor towers. We shall
begin tower equipment installation at the five new Nogales towers. At the same time we shall
install the new C2 system in Nogales C2 center. The initial five tower test shall then be
conducted. At the completion of the five tower test and Government authorization for full AoR
deployment, these five RVSS towers are ready to be put into service, pending any
reconfigurations that may be required to adjust from the five tower test configuration to the
operational configuration and completion of operator training.

After the first five Nogales towers are operating with the updated C2 center equipment, with
Government approval installation and test of the additional RVSS towers in Nogales shall begin.
For this, we plan to proceed by working on two towers at a time, being careful to meet the
requirement that no two adjacent towers be out of service simultaneously. The process uses two
eams, an equipment removal and installation team and a test team. The equipment team removes
he legacy equipment and installs the new equipment and then moves to the next site. After
completion of the equipment installation, the test team takes over and performs a two-day
configuration, integration, and test. After the first two days, there will be two sites in process at a
ime, one undergoing installation and the other undergoing test. The basic process for each tower
is as follows:

1312
1313
1314
1315
1316

1. Remove legacy equipment at the site (cameras and support equipment, microwave
backhaul): 1 day
2. Install new equipment (cameras, support equipment and microwave): 1 day
3. Test microwave backhaul: 1 day
4. Integrate RVSS tower site with the C2 center and Test: 1 day

1317
1318

At the completion of this four-day deinstall, install, integrate, and test period, the RVSS Tower
site shall be put into service (available for operational use).

1319
1320
1321

The sequence of tower sites must be carefully planned in order to insure that microwave
backhaul is available at the site since the overall microwave network is a ring, and most RVSS
Tower sites will require several hops to connect to the C2 Center.

Since CBP may begin operating the new RVSS Upgrade after completion of the 5 Tower Test
and upgrade of the first existing RVSS Tower, Train-the-Trainer (T3) operator classes shall be
conducted no earlier than 45 days and no later than 30 days prior to the start of RVSS Early
Operations. The training class shall accommodate up to 12 students per class for 2 separate
sessions, not to exceed 2 weeks for each training session IAW OTIARVSSU23_CDRL_RevA_System Training. Additional information on General Dynamics’
raining strategy is detailed in PWS Section 4.18.7 above.

1329
1330
1331

With this approach to deployment, CBP will be operating both the legacy RVSS system and the
RVSS upgrade system simultaneously for the deployment period. The duration of this
simultaneous operation varies with the number of sites in each AoR. For Nogales this is six
weeks.
