Deciding to Lease or Buy Office Management Products and Furniture
To Lease or Buy?
When you are deciding to lease or buy equipment for your organization, you will most likely
consult FAR 7.401 which will instruct you to consider comparative costs and other factors.
Unfortunately, Comparative costs and other factors vary from industry-to-industry which can can
complicate the decision-making process. To further complicate things, the calculations can
intimidate those of us who did not major in finance. Some factors may be rather simple to
evaluate. For example, you may easily discover that leasing brings the time value of money into the
cost equation. You may also discover that the cost of depreciation will affect your decision.
Unfortunately the decision is more complicated than just those two factors. That’s where the team a
GSA’s Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (IWAC) can help. They have created this calculating
ool found here to help you decide.

Understanding Residual Value
In many industries, residual value will amount to $0.00 after 60 months. This does not mean tha
equipment failure commences at 60 months. Certainly not...Especially when products like (well
maintained) office furniture can last for 15 years. Rather, it means prohibitive recovery and
reassignment costs adversely impact the residual value. Unfortunately, it does not preclude the
possibility of the lessor attributing all, or a portion of the removal costs to the lessee. In the case of
multi-functional devices, a lessor will typically bear these costs. In the case of systems furniture, the
lessee will bear the costs of removal which amount to approximately 10% or more of the purchase
price. Takeaway: It is important to factor removal costs into your decision.
Additionally, the user must accurately estimate how long the product will remain in use. In the case
of office furniture, generally, the useful life will equal or approximate the length of the lease for the
space. So, whether the agency has leased space for 10 years or 15, the product will tend to last as
long. This does not mean that the vendors are taking advantage of the government by assigning no
residual value to the product. It means that just-in-time manufacturing; high installation costs; and
product customization characterize the industry. Such circumstances result in the value of a produc
being high at its current location and worthless just about anywhere else. A kitchen remodel offers a
good analogy. A homeowner may spend $30K on cabinets and $5K on countertops. If the
homeowner wants to remove and sell the cabinets and countertops after 5 years, a buyer would
need an identical kitchen space. This is virtually impossible. Office furniture shares this same value
constraint. With both kitchen cabinetry and office furniture, the best way to maximize value is to use
it as long as possible in its original space. Takeaway: When acquiring office furniture, it is importan
o consider how long it will reside in its original space.
Note: The sample calculation at the end of this article utilizes a residual value of $0.00 to illustrate
his important point.

Cash Flow Considerations
If the Government can negotiate a significant residual value, a lease may result in a lower overall
outlay of cash. But does the lack of any residual value, then, rule out leasing as a sound economic

alternative? The answer would largely depend on opportunity costs outside of the equipment
lease. Perhaps your agency has an opportunity to forgo an option on its lease for space and save
hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on rent, but your agency cannot afford all of the upfron
costs associated with a move. In this case, a lease for furniture may make sense if the rent savings
more than offset the greater outlay for furniture. However, your agency’s leasing policies may offse
some or all of the cashflow benefits. Awarding a lease creates a liability that requires special
accounting and budgetary treatment.
OMB Circular A-11 Appendix B provides guidance with respect to the budgetary treatment of both
operating leases and lease-to-own arrangements. When using GSA Schedule 36 for multifunctional
devices or Schedule 71 for furniture, special terms and conditions address the concerns of both
he Anti-Deficiency Act and the OMB circular.
Because practices vary and because case law offers somewhat conflicting guidance, you should
consult legal counsel and your budget officials prior to executing any leases. The guidance of these
wo offices will likely help you choose between a multi-year contract, with funding from a single year
or a multiple-year contract, funded with annual appropriates. Of these two arrangements, the latter
offers a cash flow advantage, but the former may be more legally appropriate.

How Do I Calculate the Lease Cost and Payments?
Comparing the purchase price to the sum of the lease payments is one of the key steps in your
decision to lease or buy. How do you accomplish this? The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program
employs the use of the lease rate factor. The lease rate factor takes the calculus out of the lease
payment calculation, so that it can be determined using basic mathematics. Simply download the
handy calculating tool found here that automates these steps:

Step 1

Step 4
Step 5

Determine the residual value of the equipment (value at end of lease)
Subtract the residual value from the purchase price to determine the equipmen
Multiply the equipment value by the lease rate factor to determine the total interes
Add the equipment value to the total interes
Divide the total by the number of interest payments

Applying these steps to a multi-functional device (MFD) with a purchase price of $2500 would yield
he following for a 60 month lease:

2.
3.

5.

$0 (common for MFDs)
$2500
$2500*0.194 = $485 (See vendors’ price lists for lease rate factors for 36 and 60 month terms)
$2500 + $485 = $2985
$2985/60 = $49.75 per month

Conclusion
Ultimately, the decision to lease or buy depends on an agency’s plans for the items to be acquired
along with the agency’s budgetary situation. Thanks to the lease rate factor and the availability of

many online calculators, acquisition personnel can compare the cash outlays fairly easily. But the
“other factors” referenced by FAR 7.401 require significant thought and consultation with other
stakeholders.
