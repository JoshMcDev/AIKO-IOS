SECTION C: STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW): SOFTWARE LICENSE
## MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
C.1

PURPOSE

The lack of mature Software License Management (SLM) practices has left many agencies illequipped to navigate the compliance requirements associated with federal mandates, as well as
compliance with vendor agreements. Although “AGENCY X” has taken affirmative action in meeting
he mandate requirements, there are capability gaps across the people, process and systems tha
require specialized support. “AGENCY X” specifically requires IT asset management, enterprise
software license subject matter expertise, IT program management and financial managemen
support. This requirement is to acquire expertise in ensuring milestones are clearly identified and met.

C.2

BACKGROUND

Agencies are challenged with managing their software assets for a number of reasons. Among them,
is the necessary but increasingly burdensome demand for agency accountability and control of IT
program costs invoked through such policies and laws as FITARA, MEGABYTE Act, and OMB M-1612. In 2014, GAO’s published the report, “Federal Software Licenses: Better Management Needed to
Achieve Significant Savings Government-wide” (GAO-14-413) that identified a substantial deficiency
in software license management capabilities at the Agency level. The report recommended the
following five best practices for effective software license management:
1. Centralize management of software licenses
2. Establish a comprehensive inventory of software licenses
3. Regularly track and maintain comprehensive inventories of software licenses (liabilities) using
automated discovery and inventory tools and metrics
4. Analyze the software license (inventory) data to inform investment decisions and identify
opportunities to reduce costs
5. Provide appropriate Agency personnel with sufficient software license management training
“AGENCY X” requests assistance in obtaining the technology toolsets, operational processes and
change management techniques to effectively meet each of these five practices. “AGENCY X” is
requesting support to manage their environments in accordance with FITARA’s intent to reduce
"shelfware," promote reusability and only pay for what is required. The agency is looking for a
complete solution that addresses the people, processes and technology related to SLM, software
procurement, license utilization and software portfolio, and lifecycle management.
“AGENCY X” is requesting a recommended solution to manage their entire environment by providing
he business intelligence to minimize license consumption, optimize software usage rights or
entitlements, track and validate requirements, highlight security vulnerabilities from unpatched or
unsupported software versions, and manage decentralized purchasing in an enterprise manner.
The goal of “AGENCY X’s” request is to accelerate adoption of SLM industry best practices to
manage software assets throughout the product lifecycle from initial procurement, ongoing
management, upgrades, maintenance renewals, through retirement.

C.3

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this procurement is to obtain access to the relevant services required to support the
development of “AGENCY X’s” SLM program maturity. The requested scope of work includes
programmatic and design support, as well software inventory and enterprise licensing expertise,
4

including pricing. “AGENCY X” is looking to establish standardized processes throughout the entire
software lifecycle and reveal opportunities to automate SLM processes.
The Optional CLIN descriptions, tasks and deliverables associated with each are detailed in section
C.4 below.

C.4

has proposed a replacement individual whose qualifications meet or exceed those of the previous
individual in that labor category and position. They are not compared with the original
contract/task order requirements.

he qualifications of the individual(s) proposed, and any additional information requested by the
CO in sufficient detail to permit the CO to evaluate the impact on the work the Contractor is
obligated to perform hereunder.

accomplish the efforts in a timely manner. The potential impacts of a key personnel replacemen
can sideline the mission and impact the goals of the affected Program Office for a substantial

of any proposed substitution, and shall include justification, including resume(s) and labor
category of each proposed substitution(s) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impact on
ask order performance (what are the circumstances surround the individual’s departure, give a
reason why you believe it is in the Government’s best interest to accept such a change, and how
can the Government expect to maintain continuity in the efforts that are ongoing at present,
considering the retraining and re-familiarization with our organization and assigned tasks tha
inevitably has to happen with the introduction of any new individual).
● Keep in mind that if the CO and COR determine that the proposed substitute personnel is
unacceptable, or that the reduction of effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful
performance of the work under the task order, the Contractor may be subject to default action as
prescribed by FAR 52.212-4 Alt I.

Contractor may have an interest in participating.
24

● Avoid leakage of information from participants on this task order to proposal teams in the
company, or to management, who might inadvertently transmit information to proposal teams
