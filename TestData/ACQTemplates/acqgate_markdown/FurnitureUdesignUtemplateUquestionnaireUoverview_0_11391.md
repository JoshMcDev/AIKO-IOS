Design Template Questionnaire
Overview
The first step in preparing a Statement of Work (SOW) is to assess the current conditions, assets and
information available related to the project. This questionnaire is designed help select the right tasks
necessary to meet the project goals.
Completing the questionnaire will identify the tasks necessary for a successful project. Keep the
SOW tasks identified in your final SOW. Directions for editing the SOW template are embedded in
he document. After completing the edits, the result will be an SOW ready for procurement.
The Questionnaire
Project Conditions - Determine the primary objective
First we need to assess your experience with similar projects. If you have very little experience, a
designer to help with decisions and serve as an advisor will likely be advantageous. If you have very
little time to devote to the project and have some experience, then the designer may serve as an
extension of yourself, provided they understand that role.
Have you ever completed a project like this before? Do you have a basic understanding of the
design process?
•

If "No" to both questions you should engage the designer to help guide you through
he process, include Task A Market Research, Task B Project Schedule, and Task C
Project Budget. Use these tasks to get an understanding of the time, costs and
processes in the design and furnishings industries. After you gain an understanding
of the design and furniture markets, you will be able to make much better decisions
about the particular needs for your project.

If your project has these conditions: Purchase new furniture, reconfigure in-place, no major
workspace changes, then
•

Include Task D Furnishings Technical Package to include development of space
standards and typical furniture configurations. If you know where the finished
project will be and need a layout of the space or if you need or don’t have the ability
o control the design work, add Task F Space Planning.

If your project has any of these conditions: Major changes in mission or FTE, significant
contraction or expansion, potential relocation to lease space, need to improve workplace
efficiency or utilization, then
•

Include Task E Space Projection and Task D Furnishings Technical Package. The
analysis will show how to make improvements in the workflow, take advantage of
alternative office solutions, telecommuting solutions and improve overall workplace
efficiency.

If you have space standards and know what the changes are required to accommodate a change
in staffing, change in support or special space, but need the plans to communicate that change to
other entities, then
•

Include Task E Space Projection to validate the space needs and Task F
Space Planning to develop a detailed plan of the reconfigured space and
o communicate the design intent with alteration details and to convey the

extent of any alterations planned. If you plan to change the carpet, paint
colors or add some new counter-tops, a few new furniture pieces, include
Task D Furnishings Technical Package.
Tasks to Solve Specific Needs
Do you have a space plan or layout, completed to scale? If you have a plan, did the person
completing the plan have the professional training to ensure the plan meets the UFAS
accessibility requirements and local building codes?
• If "No" to either question, include Task F Space Planning
Do you know that your new or expanded space will house your projected occupants
and support space?
• If "No", include Task E Space Projection
Do you know how much space you will acquire? Do you know how many workstations, offices,
conference rooms, copy rooms, storage rooms etc., will be required in the new or expanded
space?
• If "No" to any of the two questions, include Task E Space Projection and Task F
Space Planning
Do you plan to replace the existing furniture without expanding, changing or reducing
he workstation footprints and need the procurement documents to start a furniture
acquisition project?
• If "Yes", include Task D Furnishings Technical Package
Do you have established space standards? Do you know what office and/or workstation
components are needed to meet the staff's and support space functional requirements, (i.e.
storage capacity, work-surface needs, electrical power needs, data cable needs, etc.)?
•

If "No" to either question, include Task D Furnishings Technical Package

Do you have established finish standards?
• If "No", include Task D Furnishings Technical Package and Task F Space Planning
Would you like to replace the carpet, paint and other finishes in the space?
• If "Yes", include Task D Furnishings Technical Package
Have you selected finishes for your new space?
• If "No" to either question, include Task D Furnishings Technical Package
Do you have a space plan or layout of the new/expanded or reconfigured space?
•

If "No" to either question, include Task F Space Planning

Have you conducted any furniture market analysis, visited any showrooms?
•

If "No" to either question, include Task A Market Research

Do you have a budget?
•

If "No" to either question, include Task C Project Budget

Do you have a deadline? Do you have critical milestones where this effort coincides with a related
project?
• If "Yes" to either question, include Task B Project Schedule
