Scope or Mission:

III.

Period and Place of Performance;

IV.

Background:

V.

Performance Objectives:
1.
2.
3.
4.

VI.

Operating Constraints:

Note:
1. A SOO is a short (2 or 3 page) statement of the Contracting Officer’s objectives, instead
of specific task and is included in an RFP instead of a PWS.
2. The RFP instructs each offeror to write a PWS as a part of its proposal.
3. Offerors propose tasks and standards to achieve Contracting Officer’s objectives.
4. The successful offeror’s PWS becomes a part of the contract. The SOO is discarded.
5. While this technique relieves the Contracting Officer of the task of preparing a PWS, i
greatly increases the work of source selection. Each proposed PWS must be carefully
considered and its shortcomings and pitfalls identified and evaluated in terms of the
buyers objectives.
