Statement of Work
Policy Training
*Note that this sample has been revised from the source document on the Government Point of Entry
as necessary to align formatting and applicable FAR procedures.*
SECTION 1 – BACKGROUND
The mission of CDC’s Office of the Associate Director for Policy & Strategy (OADPS) is to identify and
advance opportunities to use policy and leverage health system transformation and other sectors to
improve the public’s health. To achieve its mission, OADPS needs to support CDC-wide work to
ranslate and effectively communicate research and analysis of proposed/recommended public health
programs, policies and interventions to enable its audiences to understand their value in improving health,
reducing health inequalities, and averting healthcare and productivity costs. OADPS addresses the CDC
strategic directive to “use scientific and program expertise to advance policy change that promotes
health”. One way of accomplishing this task is per a training we call the “The Policy Academy”.
SECTION 2 – PURPOSE
The Policy Academy is intended to enhance the skills of participants in five primary competencies:
policy analysis, policy evaluation, strategic planning & systems thinking, stakeholder engagement, and
communicating policy recommendations (translating science to policy). The Academy’s curriculum
provides learning opportunities through a small variety of means, including classroom instruction, a
mentored team research project (the teams identify their own mentors, hereafter referred to as “team
coaches”), web-based training, and outside reading. The classroom portion will be limited to seven
days/approximately 40 classroom contact hours distributed across three separate sessions of two or three
days each. Those sessions are tentatively slated for late April/early May, late June, and mid-October.
SECTION 3 – SCOPE OF WORK
The CDC Policy Academy is a unique capacity-building program initiated in 2015. Its original goal was
o improve CDC workforce capacity to evaluate the potential impact of policy on the public’s health at all
levels of government, including state, tribal, local and territorial. The focus on policy analysis strengthens
participants’ skills to identify and analyze policy issues related to public health priorities.
SECTION 4 – TASKS TO BE PERFORMED
● Identify overarching objectives for the Academy professional development program and create a
robust and challenging learning structure for participants in order to enhance their ability to apply
policy in public health
● Some specific activities may include:
o Develop and deliver a course curriculum. Curriculum planning and structuring the
nomination and selection process in collaboration with the CDC program coordinator
should occur early in the PoP and in accordance with the “Deliverables/Reporting
Schedule” (Section 8 of this SOW).
● Conduct key informant interviews with CDC senior staff to identify critical policy skills for the
public health workforce
● Identify core competencies on which the Academy professional development program will be
based
● Establish learning objectives to support the competencies
● Develop a program of instruction consisting of multiple learning sessions of two or three days
each that addresses the competencies, complemented by outside reading, online courses, and/or
experiential activities
● Acquire the guest speakers for these trainings (per the guidance of CDC)

● Assist with the identification of and invitation to public health and government experts with
relevant experience to offer their insight via individual and panel presentation, including drafting
speaker invites for CDC review, sending invitations, and tracking responses.
● Provide online workspace for posting and sharing Policy Academy Materials and various
information.
● Schedule and facilitate periodic calls with the planning team (consisting of vendor and designated
CDC personnel) and provide notes from these meetings.
● Arrange and pay for Travel, Accommodations, and Per Diem (if necessary) for the guest speakers.
▪ Planning Note: 2 guest speakers per training on average.
● Identify and Secure Training Locations and Material Support.
o The Contractor shall secure training sites using CDC space and support. In the event tha
CDC training space is unavailable, with prior approval from CDC, the Contractor shall
negotiate and implement the necessary agreements and contracts with an outside training
location.
o The Contractor, with CDC approval, shall be responsible for all training logistics
including procuring and preparing training materials (textbook, binders, hard copies of
presentations, etc.) and securing staff for training support as needed, name badges,
participant packets, signs and registration systems if needed.
▪ Planning Note: Up to 25 students will be present for these trainings. Each
student will receive a textbook and training binder.
● Provide facilitation for each of the classroom sessions
Duties of the co-coordinator/facilitator would include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
● Assist the CDC program coordinator with development of the classroom curriculum
structure overall and session agendas specifically. The coordinators would jointly identify
potential topics and instructors and where they should appear in the classroom agendas. The
CDC coordinator would invite and secure instructor participation unless the co-coordinator is
acquainted with a potential instructor and would be better-suited to make the invitation.
Additionally, the co-coordinator would:
o Help prepare and participate in a “virtual open house” webinar as directed by
CDC. The webinar is normally conducted in late January or early February. The
Policy Academy team, including the facilitator, provides an overview of the structure
and curriculum, and describes the application process to interested CDC staff.
o Participate in a kickoff webinar for participants in mid-April. The CDC program
coordinator will provide the bulk of the presentation to give participants an idea of
what to expect and what the Academy entails for completion requirements. The cocoordinator is expected to describe his/her role and provide guidance to team
coaches.
o Attend and participate in the three classroom sessions full-time. The three
classroom sessions will be two or three days each. The co-coordinator can anticipate
an 8AM-5PM schedule each day (from set-up to end-of-day debrief), a total of
approximately 63 hours, including an hour for lunch. The co-coordinator may need
o meet with teams during that time to discuss their project progress (see related
“head coach” item below).
o Assist in the drafting of general learning objectives for each session. Invited
instructors normally offer learning objectives for their specific modules of instruction
(which would be included in the agendas. See the attached agendas for examples).
o Assist with the identification of and invitation to public health and governmen
experts with relevant experience to offer their insight via panel presentations. A

o

o

o

least one panel presentation per classroom session is envisioned for the 2020
Academy.
Act as lead facilitator as required during the three classroom sessions whether
during instructor or panel presentations, small group (team) exercises, or during
feedback/evaluation discussions held at the end of each day and session. On occasion
he facilitator responsibility is limited to being a “master of ceremonies” as some
instructors require no assistance of that sort.
Present on at least one current public health topic (usually a minimum of one
hour) mutually agreed-upon with the program coordinator and which would be of
interest and relevant to the participants. The application of policy to the designated
opic must be clearly evident in the instruction.
Participate in multiple meetings (in-person or via phone) to plan each classroom
session. Some of the planning will occur via email.

● Act as a “head coach” for the teams (four-five teams, four participants each). This
responsibility involves checking in periodically with each team to assess progress on their
projects, identifying what assistance they might need above/beyond what their team
mentor/team coach may do for them, and providing insight on how they might proceed (if
asked) based on the co-coordinator’s public health experience and expertise. This assistance
includes meeting with teams during the classroom sessions and receiving team updates via
email or phone in between classroom sessions.
● Attend the 2020 Academy graduation ceremony which normally occurs in December.
The co-coordinator may be asked to jointly plan the ceremony with the coordinator. The
ceremony has followed a standard structure that includes an OADPS master of ceremonies,
eam project presentations, a guest speaker keynote, and presentation of certificates.
● Offer suggestions for improvement for the current Academy or future Academies.
OADPS continually seeks to improve the quality of the “Academy experience” and would
welcome suggestions from the co-coordinator. OADPS employs a program evaluator who
will likely interview Academy staff as part of this continuous quality improvement process.
NOTE:
It is imperative that the co-coordinator is available to assist with planning and execution of the three
classroom sessions. The time estimated for planning and executing each classroom session is broken
down as follows:
o Minimum of three planning meetings per session, one hour each. Total: 9 hours
o Facilitator/presentation preparation time: 10 hours
o Classroom session execution, 7 days @ 9 hours/day: 63 hours
Additional time estimates:
o Head coach engagement with teams, four teams at 2 hours/tm total: 8 hours
o Miscellaneous email and phone communications October 2019 –December 2020: 30 hours
Total estimated time requirement: Approximately 120 hours. Planning meetings will be scheduled as
jointly agreed upon by the coordinators. The classroom session schedules will be determined depending
on selected instructor availability. Tentatively, the schedule for the classroom sessions is:
- Session 1: Early May, two days
- Session 2: Late June, three days
- Session 3: Mid October, two days

D. Incident Response
FISMA defines an incident as “an occurrence that (1) actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful
authority, the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information or an information system; or (2)
constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or
acceptable use policies. The HHS Policy for IT Security and Privacy Incident Reporting and Response
further defines incidents as events involving cybersecurity and privacy threats, such as viruses, malicious
user activity, loss of, unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data, and so on.
A privacy breach is a type of incident and is defined by Federal Information Security Modernization Ac
(FISMA) as the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any
similar occurrence where (1) a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses
personally identifiable information or (2) an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally
identifiable information for an other than authorized purpose.
OMB Memorandum M-17-12, “Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable
Information” (03 January 2017) states:
Definition of an Incident:

An occurrence that (1) actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the integrity,
confidentiality, or availability of information or an information system; or (2) constitutes a violation or
imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.
Definition of a Breach:
The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar
occurrence where (1) a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally
identifiable information or (2) an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable
information for an other than authorized purpose.
It further adds:A breach is not limited to an occurrence where a person other than an authorized user
potentially accesses PU by means of a network intrusion, a targeted attack that exploits website
vulnerabilities, or an attack executed through an email message or attachment. A breach may also include
he loss or theft of physical documents that include PU and portable electronic storage media that store
PU, the inadvertent disclosure of PU on a public website, or an oral disclosure of PII to a person who is
not authorized to receive that information. It may also include an authorized user accessing PU for an
other than authorized purpose.
The HHS Policy for IT Security and Privacy Incident Reporting and Response further defines a breach as
“a suspected or confirmed incident involving PII” .
Contracts with entities that collect, maintain, use, or operate Federal information or information systems
on behalf of CDC shall include the following requirements:
1) The contractor shall cooperate with and exchange information with CDC officials, as deemed
necessary by the CDC Breach Response Team, to report and manage a suspected or confirmed
breach.
2) All contractors and subcontractors shall properly encrypt PII in accordance with OMB Circular
A-130 and other applicable policies, including CDC-specific policies, and comply with HHSspecific policies for protecting PII. To this end, all contractors and subcontractors shall protect all

he response is positive or negative.
5) All contractors and subcontractors shall be able to determine what Federal information was or
could have been accessed and by whom, construct a timeline of user activity, determine methods
and techniques used to access Federal information, and identify the initial attack vector.

6) All contractors and subcontractors shall allow for an inspection, investigation, forensic analysis,
and any other action necessary to ensure compliance with HHS/CDC Policy and the HHS/CDC
Breach Response Plan and to assist with responding to a breach.
7) Cloud service providers shall use guidance provided in the FedRAMP Incident Communications
Procedures when deciding when to report directly to US-CERT first or notify CDC first.
8) Identify roles and responsibilities, in accordance with HHS/CDC Breach Response Policy and the
HHS/CDC Breach Response Plan. To this end, the Contractor shall NOT notify affected
individuals unless and until so instructed by the Contracting Officer or designated representative.
If so instructed by the Contracting Officer or representative, all notifications must be preapproved by the appropriate CDC officials, consistent with HHS/CDC Breach Response Plan,
and the Contractor shall then send CDC- approved notifications to affected individuals; and,
