Silent Knight Demonstration
Statement Of Objectives (SOO)
1 Scope
This SOO describes the objectives for a technology maturity demonstration of K-Band Terrain
Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) technology for the United States
Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Silent Knight program. Up to two offerors will be selected
for the demonstration phase. Demonstration findings will be used by the government to assess whether
critical technology is sufficiently mature to enter into subsequent Systems Design and Developmen
(SDD) in the timeline presented in paragraph 3.2 and Production phase.
1. Background
Market research and government sponsored tests have revealed that all technical elements required for
development and fielding of a Low Probability Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD)
Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar system are not sufficiently mature to enter an SDD
phase. Therefore, USSOCOM is commencing an effort to reduce technical risk through demonstrations
of relevant technology prior to commencement of SDD.
3. Objectives
3.1 Technical Objectives: The government’s objective is to collect and assess radio frequency
emanations and terrain data from demonstrations of relevant critical technology elements. At a
minimum, USSOCOM requires the offerors to conduct a ground range pole test to provide convincing
evidence that the requirements of the draft System Requirements Document (SRD) are achievable
during the following SDD phase. The offeror shall provide the technical approach to meeting the draf
SRD Section 3 requirements. The offeror shall provide the technology readiness levels as defined in
DOD5000.2-R Appendix 6 of the technologies they intend to use to meet the requirements identified in
he Draft SRD. The offeror may conduct other risk reduction activities for areas the offeror has
identified as high risk. The USSOCOM team will include the National Security Agency (NSA) and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL) . Both NSA and MITLL will assis
he Government to independently assess the capabilities of the demonstrated radar technologies at same
ime the contractor is performing their assessment. For each contractor’s demonstration, the
government’s independently collected raw data will be provided to that contractor within seven days of
he conclusion of the demonstration.
3.2 Management Objectives: Conduct technology demonstration efforts to determine the technical risks
for design and development of a new LPI/LPD TF/TA radar in time to incorporate government findings
into the final SRD and follow-on proposal for system design and development planned to commence in
March 2006. Demonstration and data analysis supports an aggressive government schedule with the
following critical-path milestone objectives:
(1) SDD RFP release 15 Dec 05 with nominal 50 calendar day proposal submission.
(2) SDD contract award of 29 Mar 06.

4. Technical Data Deliverables:
Offeror shall propose the appropriate Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs, DD Form 1423s) to
accomplish the Demonstration Phase which shall include a Final Demonstration Phase Plan, Schedule
and Final Report. See Section L of the RFP for proposal deliverables.

HELPFUL HINTS:
1. Consider having the offerors propose contract type. It’s negotiable, and this gives the offerors
some options in how much risk they’re willing to accept.
2. The instructions to the offerors for this solicitation neither included a quality assurance plan
(QAP) nor requested one to be submitted with proposals. “Measurable performance standards”
are mandatory elements of a performance-based contract or task order.
3. Note that research and development has been excluded from the requirement for performancebased contracting, in a memorandum issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy on
September 7, 2004. If the agency finds a reasonable way to pursue a performance-based contrac
for efforts like this one, the agency can claim credit towards the performance-based contracting
goals.
