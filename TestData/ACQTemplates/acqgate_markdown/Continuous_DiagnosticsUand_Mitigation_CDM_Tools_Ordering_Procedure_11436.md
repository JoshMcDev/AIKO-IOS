GSA/FAS/ITC IT Security Subcategory Management Operations
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Tools Special Item Number (SIN) Ordering
Procedure

Overview
In today’s cyber world, many organizations face ongoing challenges of information security
continuous diagnostics and mitigation. That is why GSA partnered with the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to develop a
new Special Item Number (SIN) for Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Tools. The
CDM Tools SIN 541519CDM supports the CDM Program. The hardware and software products
and associated services under this SIN undergo a DHS CISA product qualification process in
order to be added to the CDM Approved Products List (APL). The full complement of the CDM
Tools SIN includes tools, associated maintenance, and other related services, such as training.
The SIN scope covers the five CDM Program capabilities shown in the table below.

Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Tools Special Item Number (SIN) Ordering
Procedure

Benefits to Purchasing Organizations


Consolidates and categorizes CDM product offerings into Product Families for ease of
discovery and access.



Provides sophisticated vetting of CDM Tools prior to adding them to DHS CISA’s APL.



Allows for added flexibility and speed to market for emerging technologies related to the
CDM Program.



Supports an expanded vendor pool offering CDM Tools.

Product Ordering Process
Purchases can be made through GSA Advantage!® or by issuing a Request for Quote (RFQ)
and allowing vendors to respond to your requirements. An RFQ may be issued through GSA’s
eBuy, an electronic RFQ system that is part of the suite of on-line tools which complement GSA
Advantage!®. eBuy allows ordering organizations to post requirements, obtain quotes, and
issue orders.
State, local, regional, and territorial government entities can use eBuy to post RFQs for CDM
Tools under the Cooperative Purchasing Program. Agencies should also comply with their
organization's respective acquisition rules.
The graphic below shows the steps to follow based on the type of acquisition you are planning:
Exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), between a micro-purchase level
acquisition and the SAT, and below a micro-purchase level acquisition. The graphic for Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-1 shows the ordering procedures for acquisitions without a
Statement of Work (SOW).

Ordering Process for the CDM Tools SIN
The following section provides guidance on determining your product requirements as well as
making acquisitions on the CDM Tools SIN.

1. Determine Requirements
a. Determine your requirements/products for purchase, including Manufacturer Part/Item
Number, Manufacturer Name, Product Service Name, and Quantity. The following
resources can help you determine this information:
i. GSA Advantage!® CDM Tools vendor listing can help you find CDM products and
vendors. Browse the industry partners catalog or their price lists on GSA Advantage!
®, which will offer details such as delivery area, environmental attributes, and
warranties.
ii. GSA eLibrary’s CDM Tools page can help you review an industry partner's price list,
erms and conditions, clauses, and socioeconomic status. It can also help you find a
source within a particular geographic location. GSA eLibrary is the official online
resource for complete GSA Schedules contract award information.
iii. The CDM APL provides a comprehensive source for all CDM approved products.
This information is accessible through the CDM Tools SIN How to Order webpage.
b. Determine if an SOW is required for purchase of related services such as maintenance,
raining, or installation.
c. Determine whether your acquisition is below the SAT.

2. Purchases Under the SAT
a. Open up the GSA Advantage!® CDM vendor listing pages. Searches within this page are
filtered to show only CDM Tools SIN products and vendors.
