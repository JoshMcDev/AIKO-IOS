** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contrac

employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
he responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
his wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in
hose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
here is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

D.2 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS. (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose
offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors
considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
1. TECHNICAL FACTOR: The sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance. Sub-factor 1 is
slightly more important than Sub-factor 2, and so forth.
A. Sub-Factor 1 - Contractor’s Understanding of Wilmington National Cemetery goals: The
evaluation will consider how clearly the Contractor understands the procedures for the services called for,
and the method used based on his step-by-step description of the work flow process he will use to
execute each incident of work starting with Government notification of the requirement and ending with
he final acceptance by the Government. The evaluation will consider the Contractor’s ability to perform
he minimum order level of the contract.
B. Sub-Factor 2 - Performance Work Plan: The evaluation will consider whether the
Contractor has the required experience performing the types of services required by the statement of
work. The evaluation will consider how clearly the organizational chart or other method presents the
organization’s structure; delineates the responsibilities and lines of supervision and

SECTION D – SOLICITATION PROVISIOINS
communication; identifies the position/personnel responsible for supervision, control of performance
of various tasks under the contract, including the Contractor’s main points of contact with the
Government; and whether the proposed organization covers all the critical functions of work showing
responsibilities at each point and as a whole organization that will ensure performance of quality work
in a timely efficient manner.
C. Sub-Factor 3 - Contractor’s Personnel Qualifications: Include in this section relevan
information that shall demonstrate the technical and/or managerial qualifications of key personnel you
propose to use in accomplishing work called for under the contract. Demonstrated qualifications and
experience for each individual should be included in the technical proposal in the form of a resume or
biographical data, not to exceed two pages in length for each of the individuals identified. Key
personnel are construed to include those individuals who will directly manage, supervise or oversee
on-site contract performance, or who will provide technical advice and guidance to Contractor
personnel, or who will serve as a liaison between your firm and cemetery staff, including the COTR.
Identify alternate key personnel as backup for key personnel. Identify other personnel as to their
positions (e.g. tractor operator, lawn mower operator, trimmer operator, tree maintenance, laborer,
etc.), and any (special licenses, permits, certifications, education, experience, etc.) along with the
number of these personnel that will be utilized for complete contract performance.

94

D. Sub-Factor 4 - Past Performance: Past performance information will be obtained from
references provided by the offeror and from other sources known to the Government or learned during the
course of the evaluation. An offeror who has no relevant past performance history for a particular Second
Tier Sub-Factor will be given a neutral rating for that second tier sub-factor. Each offeror will be
evaluated on his performance under existing and prior contracts for same and similar services.
Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor
against which offeror’s relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the Government. The
Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and
complexity of the procurement under consideration. References other than those identified by the offeror
may be contacted by the Government. The information obtained may be used in evaluation of the
offeror’s past performance. Second Tier Sub-Factors 1, 2 and 3 are of comparatively equal importance.
(i) Second Tier Sub-Factor 1 - Quality of Work Performance: Past performance information will be
evaluated for offeror’s record of conforming to SOWs and providing quality service.
(ii) Second Tier Sub-Factor 2 - Timeliness of Performance: Past performance information will be
evaluated for the offeror’s ability to meet contractual performance schedules.
(iii) Second Tier Sub-Factor 3 - Customer Satisfaction: Past performance information will be
evaluated for the degree of satisfaction among the offeror’s customers.
E. Sub-Factor 5 - Equipment Readiness: Offeror is to provide a thorough list of equipment,
vehicles, and materials that it proposes to use under the contract. Equipment type, methodology and
proposed man hours should be addressed for work to be performed with explanation on how the proposed
method selected is more beneficial to the Government.

SECTION D – SOLICITATION PROVISIOINS
F. Sub-Factor 6 - Quality Control Plan: The evaluation will consider the effectiveness of the
Quality Control Inspection System, as detailed in the Quality Control Plan, to detect, remedy,
document and deter recurrences of discrepant performance or materials. It will consider whether the
lines of supervision and levels of authority are adequate to allow key personnel at the operational
level to take all corrective actions necessary to ensure quality of work by both Contractor and
subcontractor employees. The evaluation will consider the extent to which the Contractor ensures
work will proceed within the established time frames for each service called for, and whether
documentation and information feedback to the CO, or authorized representative, for all inspections
and evaluations conducted and remedial action(s) taken are sufficient to assess Contractor
performance.
G. Sub-Factor 7 - Socio-Economic Status: The evaluation will give additional consideration and
points to Contractors of small disadvantaged business status, and small service-disabled veteran owned
business status. A completed copy of the Representations and Certifications contained in Section D of the
solicitation at FAR 52.212-3 must be included with the quotation to receive this consideration. As
authorized under FAR 1.201-2, in attaining public policy goals adopted by Congress and the President, an
additional consideration of one (1) point will be given to certified Small Disadvantaged Business
Concerns, and one (1) point for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns.
2. PRICE FACTOR: This factor will consider the reasonableness of prices using price analysis
echniques. The evaluation will consider price reasonableness based on competitiveness of price offers
95

received in response to this solicitation and historical pricing data on similar contracts. The combination of
all technical sub-factors are equally important as price. Include the following as part of the price proposal:
A. Completed Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items (Page 1 of the
solicitation), which will include Blocks 12, 17A, 17b, 30a, 30b and 30c;
B. Prices as requested on Solicitation pages 6 through 10 (Section A of the Solicitation), with the
knowledge that the prices offered to the Government would be the best prices available. Each Contractor
