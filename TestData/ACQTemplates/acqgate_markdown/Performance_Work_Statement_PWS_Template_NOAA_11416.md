PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) TEMPLATE
This section presents two (2) PWS template formats: A. Basic Framework and B. Detailed
Framework. The Basic Framework is designed for use in less complex acquisitions while the
Detailed Framework is designed for use in complex acquisitions.

A. Basic Framework
1.
Scope. This section includes a brief statement of what the PWS should cover. The scope
paragraph defines the breadth and limitations of the work to be done. In some cases, the use of an
introduction, background, or both, is preferred. Separate indentures under this Section are used in
PWS to accommodate complex acquisitions requiring lengthy background information.
Background information should be limited to only that information needed to acquaint the
proposer with the basic acquisition requirement. The items listed below should not be included in
he Scope Section.
a.
b.
c.

Directions to the contractor to perform work tasks.
Specification of data requirements.
Description of deliverable products.

2.
Applicable Documents. Government handbooks, government instructions, departmen
regulations, technical orders, and policy letters, as a type, are not written in language suitable for
contract application. In the event requirements of these documents must be included in a PWS,
excerpts only should be used and should be made into either a clear task statement or a clear
reference statement for guidance only, and not for contract compliance. Any documents
identified in this section of the PWS should have the specific version referenced, i.e. by date or
by revision letter.
3.
Performance Requirements/Tasks. Specific work tasks are called for in this section of the
PWS.
4.
Contractor Quality Assurance. This section specifies requirements for the contractor’s
inspection system. It specifies particular inspections and tests which the contractor must perform.
It specifies particular inspection records which the contractor must maintain. The inspection of
services clause in a government service contract requires that the contractor maintain an
inspection system that is acceptable to the to the government. If the buyer has particular
requirements for the contractor’s inspection system, this section is the place to specify them
Note:
1. There is no specified format.
2. Describe the work in terms of the required results rather than either how the work is to be
accomplished or the number of hours to be provided.
3. Enable assessment of work performance against measurable performance standards.

4. Rely on the use of measurable performance standards and financial incentive in a competitive
environment to encourage competitors to develop and institute innovative and cost effective
methods of performing the work.
5. The Contractor’s Quality Assurance Plan is NOT the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
(QASP).
