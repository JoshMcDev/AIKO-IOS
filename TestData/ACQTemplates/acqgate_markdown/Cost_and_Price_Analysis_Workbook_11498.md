Welcome to the Simplified Acquisition Procedures Historical Pricing Workbook
Market conditions and Government requirements change over time. Past prices for a similar item may
not always be a good indicator of fair and reasonableness, if the current requirement is based on
products commonly traded in the commercial market place. Before using this workbook, make sure
hat the item you are purchasing and the item you are comparing it to are similar enough to warran
he analysis.

This is a simple guide to help assess the fair and reasonableness of simplified acquisition purchases (SAP).
It contains the following:
1. A simple difference and percentage calculator
2. A calulator that includes spaces for inflation and a sample write-up.
- This calculator requires that you have inputs from the Consumer Price Index or another
inflation calculator.
3. A calulator that includes formulas for escalators, price lists, catalogs, or another source of published market data.
- If your purchase uses a periodic assessment of the economic market such as the above, you
likely should use this workbook. After you input your escalators and offered prices, the
calculator will tabulate the difference and percentage difference.
Input your data into the tabs listed in grey. The calculators will return the difference and percentage difference.

Able Corp was awarded 1,000,000 gallons of Jet Fuel from their New Mexico refinery as FOB Origin. Able Corp
submitted the only offer evaluated against 8 line items, which were determined fair and reasonable on the basis of
comparison to historical prices paid for the same or similar item. Price reasonableness was determined Able Corp’s
proposed price to its current Jet Fuel contract price out of New Mexico from their previous contract. Able Corp's
current contract price was escalated to the solicitation base reference date of December 10, 2019 to allow for a
valid comparison. Able Corp’s escalated price on their current contract is $2.735100 per gallon, which is $0.064900
per gallon higher than their proposed price of $2.800000 received in response to this solicitation. This is a 2.37%
increase over the 2019 contract. Able Corp’s final proposed price for JP8 has increased slightly more than the 2019
U.S Annual Inflation Rate of 2.29%. The remaining percentage increase, 0.08%, is negligible and can be explained
on any number of common factors affecting fuel production. The Contracting Officer has verified that sufficien
analysis was performed to determine the prior price fair and reasonable and that the prices previously paid were
for quantities consistent with the current solicitation. The previous prices were determined fair and reasonable
pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i) on the basis of adequate price competition. Therefore, Able Corp’s proposed
price for Jet Fuel out of New Mexico is fair and reasonable on the basis of comparison to historical prices paid for
he same items pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii).

Hero Inc. was awarded a contract for 25,000 gallons of diesel fuel, FOB Origin by pipeline, from Houlton, ME to Van
Buren, ME. Hero Inc. submitted the only offer, which was determined to be fair and reasonable on the basis of
comparison to historical prices paid for the same or similar item. Price reasonableness was determined based on
Hero Inc.'s current contract for the same requirements. Hero Inc.’s current contract price was escalated to the
solicitation base reference date of December 10, 2019 to allow for a valid comparison. Hero Inc.’s escalated price
on their current contract is $2.773447 per gallon, which is less than their offer in response to this solicitation.
Therefore, the price has decreased from year to year. The Contracting Officer has verified that sufficient analysis
was performed to determine the prior price fair and reasonable and that the prices previously paid were for the
same quantity as the current solicitation. The previous prices were determined fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR
15.404-1(b)(2)(i) on the basis of adequate price competition. Therefore, Hero Inc.'s proposed price for this
requirement is found to be fair and reasonable on the basis of comparison to historical prices paid for the same
items pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii).
