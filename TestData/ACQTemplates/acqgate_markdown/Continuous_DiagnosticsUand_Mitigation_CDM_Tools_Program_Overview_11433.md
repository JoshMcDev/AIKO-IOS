SIN for Security Products:
Continuous Diagnostics and
Mitigation (CDM) Tools
Introduction to the CDM Tools Special Item
Number (SIN)

The General Services Administration (GSA) worked
with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) to develop CDM Tools SIN 132-44 (legacy)/
541519CDM (new) in support of the CDM program.
The CDM program is a governmentwide DHS CISA–led
program that provides federal agencies with capabilities
and tools to identify, prioritize, and enable cybersecurity
personnel to mitigate potential risks.
Before a vendor can add products to the CDM Tools
SIN, the vendor must submit the products for review on
he CDM Approved Products List (APL). This APL is the
authoritative approved product catalog for products tha
meet the department’s CDM requirements, based on
what vendors self-certify. The CDM Program reviews new
products every month, adding thousands of products to
he CDM marketplace monthly.
Once approved and placed on the APL, vendors can
apply to the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Information
Technology category to sell their product via the SIN.
The full complement of the CDM Tools SIN includes
associated maintenance and related services, such as
raining.

The following capabilities can be met through the tools
available via the CDM Tools SIN (as listed on the CDM
Technical Capabilities Volume 2 Requirements Catalog a
www.gsa.gov/cdm):
v Asset management identifies the existence of
hardware, software, configuration characteristics, and
known security vulnerabilities.
v Identity and access management identifies and
determines the users or systems with access
authorization, authenticated permissions, and
granted resource rights.
v Network security management prepares for events
and incidents, gathers data from appropriate sources,
and identifies incidents through analysis of data.
v Data protection management focuses on the
protection of sensitive data (especially privacy)
covered by data discovery/classification, protection,
loss prevention, breach/spillage mitigation, and
information rights management.
v Future capabilities include CDM cybersecurity tools
and technology not in any other group.
The CDM Tools SIN provides direct access to DHS CISA–
approved CDM products, including the latest in CDM
echnology.
