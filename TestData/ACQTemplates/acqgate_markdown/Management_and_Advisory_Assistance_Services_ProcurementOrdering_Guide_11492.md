MAS Tips and Guidance
MAS contracts offer a number of tools and flexibilities to improve and streamline the
buying process.

8

Ordering Flexibility: MAS contracts provide several alternatives to address
uncertainties with respect to requirement quantities. Those alternatives are discussed
briefly below:
● Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs): are a vehicle to fill recurring needs for
Schedule services. The benefits of using BPAs include leveraging buying power,
saving administrative time, and reducing overall procurement transactions. BPAs
allow for substantially quicker turnarounds on orders through the use of
streamlined ordering procedures, while reducing administrative burdens of
repetitive, individual orders.
○ Multiple-award vs. Single-award BPAs: both multiple-award and singleaward BPAs are allowed under MAS. To encourage competition, the FAR
establishes a preference for multiple-award BPAs. The number of BPAs to
be established is within the discretion of the ordering activity and should
maximize the effectiveness of the BPA(s). In determining whether single or
multiple BPAs are appropriate, the Agency should consider:
■ The scope and complexity of the requirement(s)
■ The benefits of ongoing competition and the need to periodically
compare multiple technical approaches or prices
■ The administrative costs of multiple BPAs
■ The technical qualifications of the Schedule contractor(s)
● Time and Materials (T&M) or Labor Hour (LH) contract/CLIN types: may be
used when it’s not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate
accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any
reasonable degree of confidence.
○ Requirements should be structured to maximize the use of FFP CLIN(s) to
he maximum extent practicable. This may result in a “hybrid” order that,
despite having T&M or LH elements, is classified as FFP for reporting
purposes.
○ Order Level Materials (OLMs): OLMs are supplies and/or services
acquired in direct support of an individual task or delivery order placed
against a GSA Schedules Program contract or Blanket Purchase
Agreement (BPA), when the supplies and/or services are not known at the
ime of contract or BPA award.

9

■ OLMs are only authorized for inclusion under a T&M or LH CLIN. A
determinations and findings (D&F) is required for the T&M or LH
portion of the order, regardless of dollar value.
■ The value of OLMs in a task or delivery order, or the cumulative
value of OLMs in orders against an FSS BPA, cannot exceed
33.33% (note: travel costs do not count towards this limitation).
■ The OCO should verify that the OLM SIN is awarded on a
contractor’s Schedule contract prior to order placement (see
gsaelibrary.gsa.gov to obtain this information). Contractors who
have not been awarded the OLM SIN are not authorized to receive
orders that include OLMs
■ The OCO is responsible for: Defining any known OLM categories
(e.g., computer usage charges, office supplies, labor); Establishing
an NTE ceiling price for OLMs; Approving proposed OLM indirec
cost fixed amount and determining it is fair and reasonable (if
applicable)
● Options: Options may be included on orders placed against GSA MAS
contracts, provided that the options are clearly stated in the requirement and are
evaluated as part of the ordering activity’s “best value” determination.
○ Order options are administered under the procedures outlined at FAR
17.2;
○ Orders must include the applicable clauses prescribed at FAR 17.208 if
he ordering activity plans to use options.
○ Note that if a 6 month extension (per FAR 52.217-8) is included, the
pricing for that extension should be included in the evaluation.
● Other MAS Features:
○ No requirement to synopsize - GSA Schedules have been synopsized a
he contract level in beta.SAM.gsa and satisfy the requirements of the
Competition in Contracting Act (Pub. Law 98-369) and FAR Part 5,
Publicizing Contract Actions. Ordering activities “shall not” synopsize (see
FAR 8.404(a)).
○ Subcontracting plans are issued and administered at the contract level,
and are therefore not required for orders issued against GSA Schedules.
○ GSA performs the contractor responsibility determination IAW FAR Part 9
at the contract level. A separate determination of responsibility is no
required at the order level.
10

○ Socioeconomic set asides: COs may, at their discretion, set aside
orders or BPAs for small businesses or subcategories of small businesses
identified in FAR 19.000(a)(3). It is important to note that 80% of all GSA
Schedule holders are small businesses and the simplified ordering
procedures for Schedule set-asides are prescribed in FAR 8.405-5, no
Part 19.

○ Orders against Schedule contracts are not exempt from:
■ Acquisition planning as required by FAR Part 7
■ Agency specific supplements
■ Bundling requirements (ref FAR 7.107)

Ordering Procedures and Resources:
● GSA Market Research as a Service (MRAS): a free service available to
customers to facilitate market research on GSA contract vehicles. The MRAS
eam issues streamlined, effective Requests for Information (RFI) which: define
and identify suppliers and contracts; research and identify supplier capabilities;
access hundreds of existing Market Reports; and provide a comprehensive
market plan, including contract suggestions, socio-economic considerations, etc.
● Other GSA Market Research Tools include:
○ Discovery
○ eLibrary
○ eBuy: If market research reveals that the number of capable and
interested vendors is low, the use of eBuy will serve to notify all vendors
on the Schedule of the selected SIN about the requiremen
● Contractor Team Arrangement (CTA): two or more GSA Schedule contractors
working together to provide a total solution to the ordering activity. The CTA
allows the contractor to meet the government agency needs by providing a total
solution that combines the supplies and/or services from the team members’
separate Schedule contracts. It permits contractors to complement each other’s

11

capabilities in order to compete for orders for which they may not independently
qualify. GSA encourages the use of CTAs to meet buyer’s requirements. Note:
FAR 9.6, Contractor Team Arrangements, does not apply to GSA Schedules
eaming. Under GSA Schedules, Teaming allows contractors to use their
individual GSA Schedules to develop a solution for the government in which each
contractor has privity of contract with the Government.
● Evaluation factors: Ordering activities have considerable latitude in structuring
heir procurement and can consider both price and other factors (e.g., pas
performance, technical capabilities and qualifications of key personnel) in
selecting Schedule contractors. When determining “best value,” an ordering
activity may take advantage of the full spectrum of “best value” techniques as
defined in FAR 2.101, from lowest-priced technically acceptable (LPTA) through
a full trade-off process. When determining which nonprice evaluation factors to
include in an RFQ, ordering activities should decide how factors will be
considered and their relative importance to other nonprice factors. This
procurement guide includes various sample evaluation factors common to
professional services contracting.
● Solicitation Methods: FAR 8.405-2(c) allows solicitations for professional
services requirements with a statement of work to be solicited:
○ Via GSA eBuy; or
○ By providing the RFQ (e.g., via email) to as many schedule contractors as
practicable, consistent with market research, to reasonably ensure tha
quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the
requirements (Note: <SAT, must be sent to at least 3)
● Checklist: Use the GSA Schedule Order: Contract File Checklist [PDF - 368 KB]
o award task or delivery orders against Schedules and to establish Blanke
Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against Schedule contracts.
● Unsuccessful notifications: If an unsuccessful quoter requests information on
an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of
he basis for the award decision must be provided (refer to FAR 8.405-2(d)). The
FAR Part 15 debriefing requirement does not apply.
