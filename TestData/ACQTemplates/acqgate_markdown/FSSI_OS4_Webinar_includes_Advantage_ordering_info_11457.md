on vendors.
We recommend that you pool together other purchases in your
office using the "Park Cart" feature on GSA Advantage.
Develop a strategy to purchase more items less frequently,
planning ahead, so that you are making larger purchases.
Remember, order minimums result in added value: better
prices and less shipping waste.
All OS4 vendors offer a convenience fee to bypass minimum
order requirements. If you need to make an order below the
minimum order, you may do so for a convenience fee.

Help Meeting Vendor Minimums:
Searching a Single Vendor’s Catalog on GSA
eLibrary

Go to GSA eLibrary,
www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov on your internet browser.
Type “OS4” into the search bar.

Select SIN under Category

Choose a vendor and click the GSA Advantage icon
under “View Catalog”

This brings you to that vendor’s catalog on GSA
Advantage. Now type the item you need under “Search
within results.”

Avoid vendors’ minimum order requirements with
Convenience Fees

● If your order is below a vendor’s minimum order requirement,
you will receive a prompt in your shopping cart.

Avoid vendors’ minimum order requirements with
Convenience Fees

● If your order remains below a vendor’s minimum order
requirement, their convenience fee will be added at checkout.

Ordering Procedure For Orders At Or Below the
Micro Purchase Threshold ($10,000)
● Attempt to distribute orders among multiple OS4 contractors.
○ Order minimums are currently $100, but some vendors will
accept lower minimums.
○ Smaller orders may be placed with vendors for a
convenience fee.
● As part of the government’s sustainable (“green”) mandates,
place larger orders to reduce the number of deliveries and
ransactions.
● Keep in mind Delivery Tier discounts for orders at $300 and
above from some vendors.

What If the Office Supply I want to buy is not on
OS4?

● In general, the OS4 program includes a wide range of
products, brands, and part numbers although not every brand
or part number may be included.
● By purchasing office supplies through OS4, customers are able
o ensure that they are meeting all relevant mandates and
procurement regulations (TAA, EO 13834).
● We recommend purchasing an item that is a “close second” to
he office supply you are intending to buy.

Orders Exceeding Micro-Purchase Threshold
but less than the SAT ($10,000 to under
$250,000)
• Orders exceeding Micro-Purchase threshold but less than the SAT
must follow FAR Part 8.405-1(c).
• Survey at least 3 contractors through GSA Advantage or reques
quotes from at least 3 OS4 awardees.

Orders equal to or above the SAT ($250,000)

● Must provide fair opportunity to all OS4 vendors
● Encouraged to use GSA’s E-Buy system or a reverse auction
● Consult FAR part 8.405-1(d) for more information

I’m outside the Continental US. Can I use FSSI
OS4?

● You can use the FSSI REQUISITION CHANNEL for OCONUS
ordering or the FSSI OS4 SIN 280 for OCONUS ordering as
well.
