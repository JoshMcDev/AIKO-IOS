Statement of Work
For
Department of Transportation (DOT) Cloud Services
Contrac

NOTE TO OUR CUSTOMERS: THIS TEMPLATE MUST BE TAILORED FOR YOUR NEED
BY INCLUDING YOUR UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS, QUANTITIES FOR WORKLOAD
(HOURS), SPECIFIC SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES, ETC. ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING
THIS TEMPLATE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THE COR.

1.0 Overview
This is a non-personal services contract to provide IT Services. The Government will no
exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services
herein. Such service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is
responsible to the Government as defined in this Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor
shall perform to the standards herein.
1.1 Background
Currently, there are several modal workloads that exist in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) East-Wes
Cloud Environment that the Department of Transportation Office of the Chief Information Officer
(DOT OCIO) does not have visibility into from oversight, cybersecurity and operational
perspectives. In addition, these modal cloud environments, in some cases, do not follow bes
practices from architectural and security defense in depth standpoints resulting in risks to the
respective modes and DOT overall. DOT OCIO seeks to remedy these risks by implementing a
robust and secure multi-tenant enterprise cloud environment that is built on DOT enterprise
standards and security controls. DOT OCIO will operate and manage this enterprise cloud
environment and migrate existing modal AWS workloads under this enterprise cloud
environment whereby modal workloads will inherit enterprise standards and controls that results
in a secure AWS DOT-wide cloud environment based on current best practices.
1.2 Objectives
For this SOW, the term ‘parent/landlord’ equates to DOT OCIO while the term ‘child/tenant’
equates to modes and operating administrations (e.g., FMCSA, FHWA, NHTSA, etc.) within
DOT.
● The contractor will provide Amazon Web Services for DOT-wide cloud environments tha
accomplish the following:
o One multi-tenant cloud environment will exist in AWS East-West with
implemented to achieve 100% fail over redundancies within the primary cloud
facility proper, regionally and nationally with appropriate geographic separation in
he event of a man-made/human disaster affecting one region. DOT expects to
authorize ‘moderate’ and ‘low’ FISMA classified workloads to be housed in this
cloud environment.
o The other multi-tenant cloud environment will exist in AWS Government Cloud
environment, and associated (or linked) to one commercial account. The AWS
Government Cloud environment shall be implemented to achieve 100% fail over
redundancies within the primary cloud facility proper, regionally and nationally
with appropriate geographic separation in the event of a man-made/human
disaster affecting one region. DOT expects to authorize ‘high’ FISMA classified
workloads to be housed in this cloud environment.
o Both DOT-wide cloud environments will be built on security defense in depth
principles adhering to applicable NIST standards to include but not be limited to

Managed Services/Ordering
1. Scope of Services from Amazon Web Services
The scope of this contract includes all currently existing and, upon announcement, new or
enhanced Amazon Web Services (AWS). For Amazon public cloud regions, all AWS
services available to commercial customers shall be made available to DOT. For Amazon
GovCloud regions, all AWS service available to GovCloud customers shall be made
available to DOT. DOT will be solely responsible for controlling Identity and Access
Management (IAM) access to all AWS Linked Accounts associated with this contract.
The reseller shall provide no restrictions on DOT’s ability to acquire Reserved Instances or
Spot Instances directly from AWS.
DOT does not initially plan to use Reserved Instances that have been pre‐purchased by
he reseller to potentially realize increased discounts, but this will be considered in the
future if beneficial to DOT and mutually agreeable with the reseller.
2. Pricing Transparency and Price Reduction Pass‐through to DOT
Due to the constant downward pricing trend in commercial cloud services driven by new
echnology and competition, coupled with the absolute minimum level of value‐add
services requested of the reseller in this SOW, the metered AWS service unit cost paid by
DOT under this contract shall never exceed the AWS unit pricing published on the AWS
Website that is effective at the time the unit of service is consumed by DOT. The same
requirement exists for non‐metered AWS services consumed by DOT such as Enterprise
support.
The AWS published unit pricing shall never be exceeded under this contract. DOT
encourages the reseller to offer discounts that apply to Amazon unit pricing, both at the
beginning of the contract, and ideally, subsequently increasing discounts for DOT as the
reseller market for AWS becomes more competitive, DOT resource consumption increases
under this contract, and the resellers processes for meeting the requirements of the
delivery become more refined and efficient.
Since DOT users of information technology are both extremely aware of published pricing
and very sensitive about ensuring DOT receives the best possible pricing, the reseller’s
application of appropriate discounts presents the best opportunity for this contract to be
viewed as responsive to Agency needs on an on‐going basis and realize steadily
increasing use. Further, CSSO will constantly be assessing the dynamic cloud services
marketplace on behalf of the DOT user base to ensure this contract remains the bes
possible vehicle for, cost‐wise and other, acquiring AWS services to meet the Agency’s very
diverse needs.
Additionally, since the reseller will provide consolidated billing services for DOT, discounts
associated with volume pricing tiers across applicable usage dimensions shall be passed
on to DOTcommensurate with each DOT AWS Linked Account’s portion of the reseller’s
consolidated AWS payer account.
Amazon applies current pricing at time of consumption and calculates volume pricing tiers

associated with applicable usage dimensions as part of its standard billing and cost
management approach for consolidated billing, so it is envisioned that meeting this
requirement will not put an additional administrative burden on the reseller.
Additionally, AWS has been known to make special cost concessions targeted at specific
entities/customers using AWS services. It is envisioned that such concessions (e.g.,
elimination of data transfer out charges, elimination of the minimum $15,000 monthly cos
of Enterprise level support, free AWS resources provided by Amazon to a DOT team or
researcher as part of science grant, etc.) may be made available to DOT by AWS through
he reseller within the period of this contract). The reseller shall pass on any such cos
concessions that may materialize to DOT.
3. Consolidated Billing
The reseller shall provide DOT with consolidated billing services for new AWS Linked
Accounts requested and provisioned under this contract. Consolidated billing services and
all related capabilities shall be ready for DOT access within five (5) business days of
contract award.
Upon request by DOT, the reseller shall also provide consolidated billing services, after
ransfer of the account, for existing AWS Linked or prior Payer Accounts used by DOT
directly or used indirectly by DOT through other arrangements with other resellers,
integrators, or federal contractors. Requests to transfer existing AWS Linked or existing
Payer Accounts will include
coordination by DOT with the existing AWS accoun
owner, including ensuring their approval, cooperation, and involvement in AWS Accoun
ransfer steps. Upon provisioning of a new AWS Linked Account for DOT or completing the
ransfer of an existing AWS Account (associated with DOT use through another
arrangement as indicated above) for purposes of the AWS reseller providing consolidated
billing services, DOT will be responsible for all subsequent costs incurred within the
Account The reseller shall not discontinue consolidated billing services for a DOT AWS
Linked Account within the term of the contract without DOT approval.
The reseller shall provide one or more separate DOT Consolidated Billing Accounts
exclusive to managing the payment of DOT AWS Linked Accounts. The reseller shall no
manage any non‐DOT AWS Linked Accounts within the DOT Consolidated Billing Account.
AWS has indicated that resellers have the flexibility to establish separate Consolidated
Billing Accounts for customers.
The first situation involves the potential concern that a reseller may have in giving DOT
direct access to their Consolidated Billing Account’s Billing Reports, including
Programmatic Billing Access, since such access may potentially provide DOT with access
o the billing data associated with other non‐DOT AWS Linked Accounts that are associated
with the resellers Consolidated Billing Account. Likewise, DOT’s billing data shall similarly
never be accessible by a non‐DOT Linked or Payer account, nor any other non‐DOT entity
or individual without an explicit request made in writing by DOT. (The Cloud Managemen
Platforms and Tools that may be used by DOT may have the requirement for a non‐DOT
AWS Account to have Programmatic Billing Access to DOT consumption and billing data
associated with DOT AWS Link Accounts managed for Consolidated Billing Purposes by
he reseller. DOT will make explicit requests for such access in writing to the reseller, and
he reseller shall enable the access within five business days.)
More information about Programmatic Billing Access and the associated access limitations
addressed by the requirement for a separate DOT Consolidated Billing Account can be

found at:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/detailed-billing-reports.html.
The second situation dictating the requirement for a separate DOT‐only Consolidated
Billing
Account involves the potential for Reserved Instances to be used by non‐DOT AWS Linked
Accounts associated with a common Consolidated Billing Account. Per Amazon’s AWS
Website, “For billing purposes, Consolidated Billing treats all the accounts on the
consolidated bill as one account. This means that all accounts on a consolidated bill can
receive the hourly cost benefit of Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances purchased by any other
account.” This requirement addresses a similar situation that exists with Amazon Relational
Database Service (RDS) Reserved Instances managed within a single multi‐customer
Consolidated Billing Account.
Further, if the management and use of EC2 and RDS reserved instances across DOT AWS
Linked accounts under a single DOT Consolidated Billing Account becomes unmanageable
for DOT, or inequitable for DOT users, due to the way Amazon allocates unused reserved
instances across multiple DOT AWS linked accounts within a single Consolidated Billing
Account, DOT may require additional Consolidated Billing Accounts.
More information about Consolidated Billing and the special rules applied to Reserved
Instances can be found at the link below (see Consolidated Billing non‐usage Charges
Section):
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidatedbilling.html#con
solidat edbilling‐ec2 .
A minimum of one DOT Consolidated Billing Accounts will be sufficient at contract start.
The reseller shall provide additional DOT consolidated Billing Accounts on upon request a
no additional charge. However, DOT plans to intentionally minimize both the number of
Consolidated Billing Accounts and AWS Linked Accounts it uses under the contract to
reduce the governance, operational, and business burden of managing multiple accounts.
4. Root Credentials for Linked Accounts:
For new AWS Linked Accounts requested by DOT, the AWS reseller shall provide DOT with
emporary root credentials to the new account. Immediately upon receipt of the temporary
root credentials, DOT will change the root credentials to eliminate AWS reseller access to
he account. Upon award of the AWS contract, DOT will indicate the name of the individual
approved to request new AWS Linked Accounts and to whom temporary root credentials
shall be provided by the AWS reseller.
5. AWS Account Holder:
After establishment of each AWS Linked Account for the Agency by the AWS reseller under
his SOW, for all intents and purposes, DOT shall be considered the “Account Holder” with
all associated rights and responsibilities, excluding the direct payment to AWS, which will
be the responsibility of the reseller as described in the requirement for Consolidated Billing
Services.
DOT’s role as the “Account Holder” explicitly includes DOT’s unrestricted and exclusive
rights and ownership of all data placed into the Account by DOT, all DOT‐developed and
DOT‐licensed software operating within the Account, and all mechanisms configured,
constructed, or developed by DOT for purposes of operating DOT workloads, applications,
and services within the Account. No system integration services are being acquired via this
AWS award such that the reseller would be required, or be allowed, to develop, apply, or

create reseller intellectual property to configure, operate, or support DOT data, DOT
workloads, DOT applications, and DOT services within the Account. As a condition of
contract acceptance, the reseller agrees it will not subsequently claim ownership of, nor
intellectual and other types of property rights to, any of the above assets operating within a
DOT AWS Linked account for which the reseller is providing consolidated billing services.
6. Administrative Account Transfer:
DOT intends to acquire cloud services under this contract up to the value and duration
stated, subject to demand. However, given that AWS is a contract vehicle and there shall
be no reseller‐owned physical, virtual, software, data, or intellectual property assets
associated with AWS Linked Accounts with which DOT’s role is the Account Holder (as
described above), DOT retains the right, no sooner than one Month after contract award, to
administratively transfer, with at least 15‐days notice, its AWS Linked Accounts to an
Amazon consolidated billing account assigned to another reseller, integrator, federal
contractor, or federal agency should DOT determine this is the Government’s best interest.
Similarly, DOT may subsequently choose to change any Linked Account to become a direc
DOT “payer” Account upon removal from the AWS reseller’s consolidated billing account. In
all cases involving the transfer of a DOT AWS Linked Account from the AWS reseller’s
consolidated billing account, DOT will be responsible for paying the reseller under this
award for all DOT AWS Linked Account charges incurred prior to the transfer. The AWS
reseller agrees to support, without additional cost, the administrative transfer (de‐linking) of
he DOT AWS Linked Account, upon request by DOT, out of the resellers consolidated
billing account without requiring any termination or interruption of active AWS services
within the DOT AWS Linked Account during the transfer process.
Information about AWS consolidated billing and enabling AWS linked accounts for
consolidated billing is found at:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated‐
billing.html
.
7. Access to Selected Pages and Information from the AWS Billing Management Console:
For each AWS Linked Account managed by the reseller for purposes of providing
consolidated billing services for DOT, the following access and use is required by DOT
from the Linked Account Billing Management Console:
a. Full access to view and use Billing Dashboard
b. Full access to view and use the Bills page (including downloading bills)
c. Full and Enabled access to, and use of, Cost Explorer
d. Full access to, and use of, the Account Setting page and options
i. As stated previously, DOT will not utilize the Amazon Reserved Instance Marketplace
with any AWS Linked Accounts under this contrac
e. Full and Enabled access to, and use of, AWS Reports

For each AWS Linked Account managed by the reseller for purposes of providing
consolidated billing services for DOT, the following Settings are required by DOT, on the
Billing Management Console associated with each DOT Consolidated Billing Account:
7.1
Enable Cost Explorer:
The reseller shall enable DOT to use “Cost Explorer” for all DOT AWS Linked Accounts by
selecting the “Enable Cost Explorer” option for each Consolidated Billing Account used to
provide DOT with Consolidated Billing Services for its AWS Linked Accounts.
7.2
Receive Billing Alerts:
The reseller shall enable DOT to receive direct “Billing Alerts” for all DOT AWS Linked
Accounts and for AWS Services operating within the accounts by selecting the “Receive
Billing Alerts” option in the Preferences section of each Consolidated Billing Account used
o provide DOT with Consolidated Billing Services for its AWS Linked Accounts.
7.3
Receive Billing Reports:
The reseller shall enable the generation of “Detailed Billing Reports” for each DOT AWS
Linked Account by selecting the “Receive Billing Reports” option in the Preferences section
of each Consolidated Billing Account used to provide DOT with Consolidated Billing
Services for its AWS Linked Accounts.
Unfortunately, AWS Linked account access to three important AWS Detailed Billing Reports
is not an automatic option today under Consolidated Billing Services. However, DOT
requires access to the these Detailed Billing Reports to responsibly manage Agency costs,
so unrestricted access via reseller action under this contract shall be required as indicated
below for each Detailed Billing Report.
a. Monthly report: Lists AWS usage for each product dimension used by an account and its
IAM users in monthly line items. Can be downloaded from the Bills page of the Billing and
Cost Management console. <AWS account number>‐aws‐billing‐csv‐yyyy‐mm.csv
i. DOT Access Frequency Requirement: On‐demand access to latest updates from Billing
Management Console (No reseller action required due to there being no existing AWS
Linked Account access restrictions).
b. Detailed billing report: Lists AWS usage for each product dimension used by an accoun
and its IAM users in hourly line items. <AWS account number>‐aws‐billing‐detailed‐line‐
items‐yyyy‐ mm.csv.zip
i. DOT Access: On‐demand via manual and programmatic method
ii. The reseller shall meet this requirement by providing DOT with direct access to the S3
object within which AWS places this report. DOT’s access to the object shall be as timely
as the access that AWS makes available to the reseller.
c. Monthly cost allocation report: Contains the same data as the monthly report, but also
includes any cost allocation tags that DOT has created. <AWS account number>‐aws‐cost‐
allocation‐ yyyy‐mm.csv
i. DOT Access: On‐demand via manual and programmatic method
ii. The reseller shall meet this requirement by providing DOT with direct access to the S3
object within which AWS places this report. DOT’s access to the object shall be as timely

as the access that AWS makes available to the reseller.
d. Detailed billing report with resources and tags: Contains the same data as the detailed
billing report, but also includes any cost allocation tags DOT has created and ResourceIDs
for the AWS resources used by the account. <AWS account number>‐aws‐billing‐detailed‐
line‐items‐with‐ resources‐and‐tags‐yyyy‐mm.csv.zip
i. DOT Access: On‐demand via manual and programmatic method
ii. The reseller shall meet this requirement by providing DOT with direct access to the S3
object within which AWS places this report. DOT’s access to the object shall be as timely
as the access that AWS makes available to the reseller.
The DOT‐designated Points of Contact (POCs) who are approved for manual and/or
access to the Billing Reports will be provided to the reseller.
End of Month versions of the Billing Reports (a., b., c., d. above) shall be kept available for
manual and programmatic access by DOT for three months.
More information about the Detailed Billing Reports, described above, can be found at:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/DetailedBillingReports.html
.
Note: DOT understands the detailed billing reports indicated above are not actual bills, bu
an estimate of costs and charges for AWS usage.
For each AWS Linked Account managed by the reseller for purposes of providing DOT with
consolidated billing services, DOT will only access the following capabilities available from
he Billing Management Console in accordance with the conditions provided below:
a. Access to Payment Methods Section (only for purposes of administrative accoun
ransfer)
b. Access to the Consolidated Billing Section (N/A for Linked Accounts)
c. Access to the Credits Section (when redeemable credit codes are provided by reseller)
d. Access to the DevPay Section (never)
8. Cost Allocation and Usage Tags:
DOT plans to use Cost Allocation and Usage Tags for granular cost and other reporting
within all AWS Linked Accounts. As such, DOT will regularly provide the reseller with a lis
of new and no‐ longer‐required Cost Allocation and Usage Tags so the reseller can indicate
which Cost Allocation and Usage Allocation Tags will be included or excluded in the Billing
Reports required by DOT above. The reseller shall ensure Cost Allocation and Usage Tag
updates are made for each AWS Linked Account by the close of the next business day (5
p.m. Eastern time) so the Tags are reflected within the Billing Reports. As preferred
alternative, DOT will perform the steps necessary to address this requirement if provided
adequate access by the reseller to the DOT Consolidated Billing Account.
9. Master Payer Account:
The contractor must allow DOT to run AWS organizations with all features enabled in the

Master Payer account.
10. Enterprise Support:
The contractor must provide AWS Enterprise Suppor

accessible to people with disabilities. Federal employees and members of the public who have
disabilities must have equal access to and use of information and data that is comparable to
hat enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public.
All deliverables shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of
Section 508 unless exemp
Breach Response - The Contractor agrees that in the event of any actual or suspected breach
of Sensitive PII (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an
unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), it shall
immediately, and in no event later than one hour of discovery, report the breach to the
contracting officer, the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), and the DOT Privacy Officer
(DOTsecurity@dot.gov). The Contractor is responsible for positively verifying that notification is

received and acknowledged by at least one of the foregoing DOT parties.
Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement - The Contractor has in place
procedures and the capability to promptly notify any individual whose Sensitive PII was, or is
