Software License Management Service (SLMS)
A Customized Approach to Supporting Your Agency’s IT Program

What is Software License Management
Service (SLMS)?
SLMS is a shared service developed and managed by GSA
hat will give agency chief information officers (CIOs) the
ools they need to better understand their software-asse
inventory, defend against compliance audits, and optimize
software that is unused or underutilized. SLMS enables

program.

Why do Federal Agencies Need SLMS?
The U.S. government is by far the largest buyer of software in
he world, spending $9.1 billion on commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) software1 every year through more than 50,000
separate transactions.
As much as 30 percent (i.e., $2.7 billion) of this spend
is unnecessary. Federal buying practices are inefficient,
decentralized, and uncoordinated.

providing transparency on IT resources across agencies,
racking spend, maintaining accurate inventories, and
accomplishing cost savings on software.

How does SLMS Help Agencies?
SLMS helps agencies cut costs (e.g., show positive Return on
Investment [ROI], decrease overall software spend), comply
with federal mandates, and enhance cybersecurity posture by
eliminating unused, unsupported, or obsolete (i.e., vulnerable)
applications through a vendor-agnostic solution able to
coexist with any legacy agency software systems.
