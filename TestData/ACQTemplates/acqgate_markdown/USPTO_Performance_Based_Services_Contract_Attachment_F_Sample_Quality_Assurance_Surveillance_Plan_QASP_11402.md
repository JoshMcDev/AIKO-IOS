OHR Operational and Customer Service Support Contract
50/52PAPT301014
## ATTACHMENT F
SAMPLE QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)
Applicable for the
USPTO OHR Operational and Customer Service Support Contrac
1. PURPOSE
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and
applied document used to make sure that systematic quality assurance methods are used
in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards
included in this contract and in subsequent task orders issued thereunder. The intent is to
ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in
he contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in
he contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services
received.
2. AUTHORITY
Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E – Inspection
and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the articles, services,
and documentation called for in task orders to be accomplished by the Contracting
Officer or his duly authorized representative.
3. SCOPE
To fully understand the roles and the responsibilities of the parties, it is important to firs
define the distinction in terminology between the Quality Control Plan and the Quality
Assurance Surveillance Plan. The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for
management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth
by the contract and follow-on task orders. The Contractor develops and submits his
Quality Control Plan (QCP) for Government approval in compliance with his contrac
deliverables. Once accepted, the Contractor then uses the QCP to guide and to rigorously
document the implementation of the required management and quality control actions to
achieve the specified results. The QASP on the other hand, is put in place to provide
Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor’s quality control efforts to assure
hat they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the contract or
ask order. The QASP is not a part of the contract nor is it intended to duplicate the
Contractor’s QCP. The Government has provided the Contractor an informational copy of
he QASP as an Attachment to the solicitation to support the Contractor’s efforts in
developing a QCP and for providing the contractor an opportunity to comment and
propose innovative solutions for the Government’s QASP.
4. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES
