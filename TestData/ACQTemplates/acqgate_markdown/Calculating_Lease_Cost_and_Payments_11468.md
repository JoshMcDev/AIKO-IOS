How Do I Calculate the Lease Cost and Payments?
Comparing the purchase price to the sum of the lease payments is one of the key steps in your decision to lease or
buy. How do you accomplish this? The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program employs the use of the lease rate
factor. The lease rate factor takes the calculus out of the lease payment calculation, so that it can be determined
using basic mathematics. Simply follow these steps:

Step 1 - Determine the Residual Value of the equipment (value at end of lease)
Residual value may be negotiated with the vendor. However, in many industries,
residual value will amount to $0.00 after 60 months. See article for explanation.

Step 2 - Subtract the residual value from the purchase price to determine the equipment value

Step 3 - Multiply the equipment value by the Lease Rate Factor to determine the total interest cost

The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program employs the use of the lease rate factor,
which can be found on each GSA contractor's price list.

Step 4 - Add the equipment value to the total interest

Step 5 - Divide the total by the number of interest payments

Example:
Applying these steps to a multi-functional device (MFD) with a purchase price of $2500 would yield the following for
60 month lease:
1. $0 (common for MFDs)
2. $2500
3. $2500 * 0.194 = $485 (See vendorsâ€™ price lists for lease rate factors for 36 and 60 month terms)
4. $2500 + $485 = $2985
5. $2985/60 = $49.75 per month
