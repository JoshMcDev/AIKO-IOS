Guide to GSA Technology Contracts

Acquisition Options for Your Specific
Technology Requirements
Acquiring technology is easy with GSA. You
can use our Governmentwide Acquisition
Contracts (GWACs), Information Technology
(IT) Category on GSA Schedule, and the
Network Services Program (NSP) contracts

elecommunications, and infrastructure
products, services and integrated solutions.
Our comprehensive set of pre-competed and
customizable acquisition solutions supports
your technology life cycle needs – from
management to execution – at competitive
prices.
IT, telecommunications, and infrastructure
are integral to agency mission requirements
across all aspects of government. Agencies
also face constantly shifting priorities
– ranging from cloud computing and
infrastructure consolidation to cybersecurity
and environmental sustainability. With tigh
budgets and a smaller workforce, finding
he right solution to meet your IT needs
as well as your telecommunications and
infrastructure needs can be a significan
burden.
At GSA, we enable smart decisions when
evaluating, purchasing, and implementing
echnology – from navigating available
commercial offerings to determining the
most appropriate acquisition vehicle.
Working with leading industry partners and
your in-house contracting professionals,
we maximize operational effectiveness and
efficiency while minimizing acquisition risks.

anything technology-related to meet your
mission requirements – such as infrastructure
and applications, mobile managemen
solutions, professional IT services, and
communications services.

Whenever your agency needs suppor
addressing our nation’s priorities, GSA
stands ready to work with you across a broad
spectrum of IT initiatives while ensuring
your compliance with federal mandates and
policies. These initiatives include protection
against cyber threats, progress toward
environmental sustainability, evolution to a
more mobile workforce, support of small and
veteran-owned businesses, and migration of
your computing systems to the cloud.
