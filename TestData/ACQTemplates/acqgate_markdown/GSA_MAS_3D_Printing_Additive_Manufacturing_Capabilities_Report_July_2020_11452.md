GSA MAS 3D Print/Additive Manufacturing Capabilities - Products and Services
As we continue to support the COVID-19 pandemic and also prepare for post COVID-19, GSA has continued to expand the 3D printing/additive
manufacturing (3DP/AM) solutions available under the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program. Through the GSA MAS Program, you have access
o agile, long-term government wide contracts with commercial companies that provide access to innovative commercial products and services a
fair and reasonable prices. These companies are regularly adding new and innovative 3D Print/Additive Manufacturing products and services to
heir GSA contracts to meet unique and evolving needs.
This report was compiled on July 31, 2020 and includes a snapshot of GSA MAS sources for the broad range of 3D Printing capabilities listed in the
below chart. Our goal in continuously expanding capabilities under the MAS program and providing this capabilities report is to help agencies mee
operational requirements, maximize their procurement budgets, extend the useful life of their equipment/systems, and secure their supply chains
from prohibited products.
