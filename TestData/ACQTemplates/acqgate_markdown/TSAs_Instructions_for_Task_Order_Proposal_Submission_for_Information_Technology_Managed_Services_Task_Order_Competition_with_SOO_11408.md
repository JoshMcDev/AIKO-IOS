Instructions for Task Order Proposal Submission
For
TSA Information Technology Managed Services (TSA ITMS) Task Order
Competition
Overview:
The Transportation Security Administration is conducting a task order competition to enter into a
performance based arrangement to acquire information technology and telecommunication managed
services required to meet TSA’s responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders.
As noted in TSA ITMS’s Statement of Objectives, this effort will include the full range of services
needed to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate all IT
products and services needed to “stand up,” as well as maintain, information technology and
elecommunication services for TSA.
The competition to establish a performance based managed services arrangement has introduced
several changes from traditional approaches. Two of the more significant are the use of a Statemen
of Objectives (SOO) versus a Statement of Work (SOW), and the introduction of a due diligence
period to enhance a competing contractors understanding of the basic requirement.
Under a SOO, the Government describes its requirement in terms of desired objectives. Contractors
will be asked to propose solutions that they believe will best meet or exceed the objectives. In
essence, the Government states the problem it wants solved, and industry is offered the freedom to
propose what they consider the best solution. Under a SOO, the Government is changing the very
nature of what it is acquiring from the traditional compliance with a Government developed SOW,
o performance results.
A due diligence period has been incorporated into the proposal preparation period. Due diligence is
a commercial best practice that allows industry much greater access to information regarding the
problem the Government wants solved. It is understood by the TSA ITMS program office that the
more contractors understand the problem and constraints, the more likely they will submit superior
proposals (solutions). Guidance for conducting the due diligence sessions is provided below.
The following provides prospective TSA ITMS contractors information to assist in preparation of
heir task order proposals.

Task Order Concept of Operations:
It is envisioned that a task order resulting from this competition will be structured to allow
significant flexibility for ordering and use. As mission needs dictate, a significant portion of
enabling computational and communication services will be acquired via work orders or calls from
his task order’s pre-established price lists. Requirements such as application software developmen
and other services will require submission of individual work order proposals for consideration,
negotiation and award.
While the scope of the task order includes the full range of information technology and
elecommunication services, it is intended that the contractor selected for this task will provide, as
ordered, core services relating to computing infrastructure (e.g., “seats”, data center processing, and
associated LAN/WANs and telecommunications).
Non-core functions such as application software development and/or application program produc
selection (e.g., Human Resources, Payroll, Financial systems etc.) will be ordered on a case-by-case
basis. While the TSA will encourage collaborative dialog and explore options regarding major
system software applications as part of the TSA ITMS effort, TSA reserves the right to selec
application software and/or acquire software development services from sources other than the TSA
ITMS contractor.

ISE and SOM.

Contractor Viability Assessment
The Government has carefully constructed Section M, Evaluation Factors, to identify the key
discriminators (e.g., quality and comprehensiveness of the technical solutions, performance
measures, past performance (including “Gartner Rating”), etc.) that it will use in making its
selection decision. Due to the significant expense and effort associated with proposing against a
Statement of Objectives based requirement for a performance based task order, contractors
contemplating competing for this task order award are asked to carefully review Section M and
make a realistic self-assessment as to their potential viability.

The Government will be providing a Cost Model, for evaluation purposes only, at a later date.
Contractors shall submit the provided Section B Table/Cost Model along with supporting information
“other than cost or pricing data”, required to evaluate the reasonableness and realism of proposed cost /
prices. This includes providing a complete breakout of the cost items that make up each orderable
service. The cost proposal should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate cost reasonableness as well as
provide a baseline for future modification/changes. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed
costs / prices rests with the Contractor.
Oral presentations will be conducted with all contractors submitting a proposal who are determined to
be in the competitive range. The contracting officer will schedule oral presentations. Four (4) hours
will be provided for each presentation.
Contractors participating in oral presentations must provide all necessary audio-visual materials.
While the Government has provided a recommended topic list in Attachment J-3, it has not established
a formal structure for oral presentations (e.g., slide limitations, format, agendas etc.) Presenting prime
contractors and their team members may use the four-hour period as they deem most advantageous to
describe there proposed solution/approach and pricing structures.
It is required that individuals presenting be those identified as key personnel and/or senior
management. It is important to the Government that the individuals responsible for performance of
his task order are the ones that present at the oral presentations. Due to space limitations, 10 people
are allowed to attend for each presentation; 15 copies of the oral presentation in hard copy should be
presented to the Government team on the day of the presentation.
Oral presentations will be video taped by the Government.
The purpose of these presentations it to allow the Government to better understand the proposed
solution/approach, as well as other aspects of the proposal. As such, Government participants may ask
questions throughout the presentation. Contractors will also be given the opportunity to ask the
Government questions during this time.

L.5
Due Diligence
Review (DDR)

It is well understood by the TSA ITMS program office that the more competitors understand TSA’s
objectives, plans and operations, the more likely they are to submit superior solutions. ITOP II
Contractors intending to submit a TSA ITMS Task Order proposal and their team members will be
given the opportunity to conduct a due diligence survey of TSA locations and meet with TSA
representatives. The due diligence process allows prospective contractors to gain a better
understanding of TSA mission objectives and existing conditions.

L.5.1
Exchanges

The due diligence process will follow the principles identified by Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Part 15.201, Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals. Specifically, during oneon-one sessions, a major objective of the due diligence process is to provide confirming contractors
and their team members the ability to ask questions that by their very nature they would not ask if the
response would be posted and provided to their competition. As such, if the confirming contractor
notifies the Government that the questions it intends to ask during the one-on-one sessions are
proprietary and whose release would identify confidential business strategies, or approaches, the
questions and responses will be protected and held confidential.
Requests for clarification that result in specific information necessary to submit proposals
will be provided to all confirming prime contractors.
The Government will provide competing contractors equal access to data and information. The
Government assumes no responsibility for any representation made by any of its officers or agents
during due diligence. Contractor questions and Government responses furnished during due diligence
are unofficial. If requested, the Government will attempt to provide an official response within the due
diligence time period.

L.5.2
Confirmation
of Intent to
Submit a Task
Order Proposal

Upon release of the task order RFP, each contractor intending to submit a proposal as a prime will
confirm its participation in the task order selection via an e-mail to: _____________________ by
4 :00 p.m. local time Friday, 14 June 2002.

L.5.3 DDR Events

Due Diligence will include the following events:

L.5.4 Overview
Session

The due diligence process will begin with an overview briefing session by government
echnical/management personnel knowledgeable of the TSA sites and requirements. The governmen
will schedule and hold the overview session in the TSA Headquarters. The overview session will
include a question and answer period.

L.5.5 One-on-One
Sessions

Following the overview session, confirming contractor teams will be given the opportunity to meet
one-on-one with TSA representatives knowledgeable of the current environments and requirements to
better understand TSA’s underlying mission and technical environment. The purpose of these
meetings is to allow confirming contractors to obtain and clarify information without disclosing
proprietary or business confidential information to competitors. The government will schedule and
hold these sessions at TSA Headquarters.

The confirmation will include the following information to enable the government to effectively
coordinate due diligence events: The contractor’s due diligence contact point (name, telephone
number and e-mail address); a roster of attendees for each due diligence event listed below; key areas
of interest; and any additional information the Contractor deems necessary (e.g., handicap access
requirements).

In accordance with FAR 52.219-9, Contractors who are not small businesses shall submit a Small
Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan for each task order equal to or
exceeding $500,000.
As noted in Section M Evaluation factors, a factor in the selection and award of a task order from this
competition will be the proposed opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small
business concerns, veteran-owned, disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone small businesses.

L.7 –
Conflict Of
Interes

Any contractor(or member of its team (and/or subcontractor)) having a conflict of interest as defined
under FAR Part 9.5 must identify the conflict as soon as it is known and provide a recommended
mitigation plan. Mitigation plans are required whenever a competing contractor has had unequal
access to non-public information regarding the TSA ITMS requirement and/or competition, or has
assisted the Government in defining the TSA ITMS requirements or evaluation criteria.

L.8 –
Use of NonGovernmen
Advisors

The Government will use the following non-Government advisors in the evaluation process:
Acquisition Solutions, Inc., Chantilly, VA
These non-Government advisors will be authorized access to only that data and those discussions tha
are necessary to enable them to provide specific guidance on specialized matters or on particular
problems. Contractors are required to provide any objection to disclosure to these non-Governmen
advisors in writing before the date set for receipt of proposals and shall include a detailed statement of
he basis for this objection. Each non-Government advisor will sign a nondisclosure certificate.

M.2 BEST VALUE

The Government intends to award a task order to the Contractor whose task order proposal is
identified as offering the best value solution. The Government intends to award a single task order as
a result of this competition.
The Government reserves the right to not award a task order as a result of this competition, if in the
opinion of the Source Selection Official (SSO), none of the submitted proposals would provide
satisfactory performance.
The Government plans to award a task order to the Contractor whose task order proposal represents
he best value solution. The Source Selection Official (SSO) may reasonably determine that the
superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the
Government. The SSO, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an
integrated assessment of the task order proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below
evaluation factors.

of Importance

The Government will evaluate the Contractor’s capability and approach to meet TSA’s objectives
against the following evaluation factors.
The evaluation factors are listed below:
Factor 1 - TSA ITMS Technical/Management Solution/Approach
Factor 2 – TSA ITMS Performance Metrics
Factor 3 - Past Performance
Factor 4 – Subcontracting and Socio Economic Business Participation
Factor 5 - Cost/Price
Factor 1, TSA ITMS Technical/Management Solution/Approach and Factor 2, TSA ITMS Performance
Metrics are equal and each is significantly more important than Factors 3, Past Performance and Factor
4, Subcontracting and Socio Economic Business Participation. Factor 3 Past Performance is more
important than Factor 4 Subcontracting and Socio Economic Business Participation. While the
Cost/Price factor will be an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price
evaluation factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.
However, Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
factors approach equal.

past performance.
The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor’s actual performance on two (2)
similar efforts. This review will focus on the size scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance
measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

socio-economic categories.
(c) Integrates partners and subcontractors into the performance plan.

(a) Evaluation of proposed price/cost
(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition
and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average
rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)

Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill
mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the
Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the
estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear
understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the
Contractor's technical proposal.

(d) Cost Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes.
Note: As the labor categories and composite labor rates under the ITOPII contract have already been
determined fair and reasonable, they will be accepted under this task order proposal.

expected to result in superior achievement of TSA’s objectives with minimal risk. A
“Blue” rating indicates that the proposal contains significant strengths and few or no
weaknesses.
The Contractor’s proposal offers approaches/solutions that if implemented, introduce
moderate risk but is considered likely to produce performance results meeting TSA’s
objectives. A “Green” rating indicates that the proposed solution contains a number of
strengths, but also some weaknesses.
The Contractor’s proposal offers approaches/solutions that if implemented, introduce
a high risk that expected performance would achieve TSA’s objectives. A “Yellow”
rating indicates that the proposed solution contains strengths, but also significan
weaknesses.

Attachment J – 4 — TSA ITMS Statement of Objectives
Transportation Security Administration
Information Technology Managed Services
Statement of Objectives
1.0 Overview
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is conducting a task order competition to enter
into a potential $1 billion information technology managed services arrangement (up to 7 years) for
he delivery of a wide range of Information Technology outsourcing services to support the
Department’s information processing, IT security, telecommunications, and other related
information technology requirements. This statement of objectives identifies the Transportation
Security Administration’s Information Technology Managed Services program’s major goals and
overarching performance objectives.
As all concerned with the security of this nation are undoubtedly aware, the Transportation Security
Administration was established in response to the terrible tragedy of 9/11/01. Congress passed, and
President Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, P.L. 107-71 establishing TSA
and mandating improvements in securing the nation’s transportation systems.
President Bush has set a clear goal for TSA: Every American has the right to expect a secure,
accessible, affordable and reliable transportation system. While TSA’s first year’s efforts are
focused on securing the air transportation system, its larger mission is to protect the nation’s entire
ransportation system (e.g., rail, highways, transit, maritime and pipeline, etc.) to ensure freedom of
movement for people and commerce.
It is well understood that meeting the information technology requirements of a newly formed,
highly dynamic organization represents an enormous task. As a new agency, TSA faces many
challenges. Not the least of these tasks is to quickly establish IT and telecommunication
infrastructure support and services for the potential 67,000 employees at various locations
including: headquarters, over 400 airports, 21 field offices, the TSA Command Center, and yet to be
identified locations and customers. As such, TSA’s Associate Under Secretary for the Office of
Information Technologies, requires a world-class contractor to provide a comprehensive, enterprisewide information technology managed services solution to assist TSA in meeting its responsibilities
under Federal legislation and executive orders.
A key underpinning of this effort is the understanding that contractor-provided information
echnology and telecommunication services are not the total product being acquired. There exist a
large number of companies who can provide personal computers, laptops and data services hooked
up to telecom and local area networks. Commonly referred to as a “seat,” the focus of tha
arrangement has primarily been on the operation of the computer equipment and not how the
application of information technology enhances the performance of the organization.

Under the TSA Information Technology Managed Services effort, it is understood that the
information technology services being delivered are enablers and do not represent in totality wha
TSA is acquiring through this task order. Rather than focus entirely on performance of a seat, or
data center, TSA desires that the winning contractor also bring a mission focus that not only
provides highly effective, secure and reliable computing resources, but also continuously identifies
methods for applying information technology to improve TSA’s mission performance. TSA desires
a contractor that brings not just seats, but the expertise to identify, implement, and manage the mos
effective and efficient application and use of information technology, to meet TSA’s mission.
2. Task Order Scope
The TSA Information Technology Managed Services (ITMS) task order effort encompasses the full
range of information processing and telecommunications services required to meet TSA’s
responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders. The estimated value of this task
order over its potential 7 year life is $1 billion.
As ordered, the contractor is responsible for providing all necessary information technology and
elecom (e.g., hardware, software (operating and application), servers, security capability, (e.g.,
meeting SBU/Law enforcement sensitive and classified standards), wireless devices/capabilities,
PDAs, land mobile radios, data center services, (including continuity of operation), WAN/LAN,
voice and data telecom, and services, application development and maintenance, help desks,
business process reengineering, etc.), and program management to meet or exceed TSA’s ITMS
program objectives.
This effort will include the full range of services needed to analyze requirements, develop and
implement recommended solutions, and operate all IT products and services needed to “stand up,”
as well as maintain, information technology and telecommunication services for TSA. This
includes taking the “as is” state and providing the winning contractor’s “to be” solution. (Note:
while the current organization has limited information technology infrastructure in place, it must be
considered and accommodated in providing the final solution.) As such, TSA requires, under an
information technology managed services arrangement, information technology,
elecommunications, and related services to provide and manage an architecture and information
echnology infrastructure that is timely, standard, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive,
compliant, and cost effective in meeting needs of TSA and its stakeholders.
Further, given the pace of change in the information technology and telecommunications
marketplace, it is impossible to anticipate how individual TSA requirements – and, indeed, how the
marketplace – will evolve over the life of the contract. The TSA ITMS scope is intended to
accommodate advances in technology that will allow it to continue to improve TSA’s mission
performance. Throughout the life of this agreement, the TSA ITMS Contractor is encouraged to
seek ways to incorporate innovative and emerging technologies that, in the most economic and
efficient manner and with a view to return on investment objectives, improve both information
echnology system performance and (more importantly) support and improve TSA’s mission
performance.

2.0 Partnering Philosophy
A major intent of this Statement of Objectives is to create a “partnership” between TSA and the
contractor. TSA intends to structure the contract in a manner that ensures that the contractor’s goals
and objectives are in alignment with those of the agency. Superior performance on the contractor’s
part will directly and indirectly link to superior TSA mission accomplishment through the economic
and efficient use of information technology. Within the context of the TSA/contractor partnership,
TSA does not use the terms “partner” and “partnership” as legal terms. The TSA/contractor
partnership will reflect the attributes of an open, collaborative, and customer-oriented professional
relationship. In addition to meeting program objectives, the contractor is encouraged to:
a) Consistently take steps to understand TSA’s crucial business issues and opportunities.
b) Share the risks and responsibilities of joint implementations and initiatives.
c) Ensure its products and services deliver tangible and meaningful business benefits.
d) Work collaboratively with other contractors, government agencies, and business partners to
ensure project success.
e) Resolve the complexities and difficulties that are characteristic of implementing, integrating,
maintaining, and securing mission-critical IT systems and solutions.
f) Periodically measure and forecast capacity and systems growth in sync with TSA capital
planning requirements and constraints.
Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements
will be used extensively to monitor the performance of this contract. TSA’s Office of Information
Technologies (OIT) and the winning contractor will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to
performance metrics and service level agreements.
4.0 TSA Information Technology Managed Services Program Objectives
The objective of TSA’s ITMS requirement is to quickly, efficiently, effectively, and economically
provide and maintain a standard Information Technology platform and infrastructure to support TSA
employees in meeting TSA’s mission. As such, the objective of this requirement is to:
a) Receive under a performance-based arrangement, highly reliable, and secure, IT managed
services and support that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations.
b) Establish a partner-focused working relationship with TSA.
c) Continuously seek ways to apply information technology to improve TSA mission
performance.
d) Throughout the life of this effort, demonstrate improved performance, reliability, security,
and reduced cost of the delivered service.
e) Given the dynamics of establishing a new agency, establish a contract arrangement tha
easily accommodates change.
