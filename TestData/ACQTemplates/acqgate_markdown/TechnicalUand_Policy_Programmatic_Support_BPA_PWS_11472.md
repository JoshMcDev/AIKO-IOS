1. General: This is a non-personal service Multiple Award Blanket Purchase (MA-BPA)
o provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs for energy supply and
end use, technical, policy, programmatic and analytical support.
1.1. Description of Services/Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel,
equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other
items and non-personal services necessary to perform technical, policy, programmatic
and analytical support to EPA’s program for energy supply and end use as defined in
his PWS except for those items specified as Government furnished property and
services. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this BPA.
1.2. Background: The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate
Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) is to protect public health and the environmen
while fostering economic growth by accelerating market and policy transformation in the
energy sector and empowering individuals and organizations to reduce air emissions.
Significant cost-effective opportunities exist for reducing emissions and energy waste
from the energy sector (supply and end-use). Some opportunities arise from improving
he efficiency of energy generation processes or energy end-use, while others involve
replacing carbon-intensive fuels with less-carbon-intensive fuels to generate energy.
These opportunities can be found in all scales of energy generation and consumption in
utility, commercial, and end-use sectors.
The new BPA will continue to assess opportunities for cost-effective technology
applications, analyzing the potential barriers, and undertaking program activities to
overcome the identified barriers.
In addition to these clean energy supply technology activities, EPA also seeks to
encourage GHG emissions management through standard corporate GHG accounting
and inventory practices and application of best GHG mitigation practices. The Center for
Corporate Climate Leadership provides interested companies and organizations with
he tools to assess and mitigate their GHG emissions with demonstrated expertise in
GHG management, and helps set the standard for GHG management and leadership
hrough recognition of market leaders.
PROGRAM AREAS CPPD consists of five branches: Energy Supply & Industry Branch,
State & Local Branch, ENERGY STAR Commercial & Industrial Branch, ENERGY STAR
Residential Branch, and the ENERGY STAR Labeling Branch. This PWS primarily

focuses on two CPPD Branches: Energy Supply and Industry Branch (ESIB) and the
State and Local Branch (SLB).
ENERGY SUPPLY AND INDUSTRY BRANCH (ESIB) ESIB is responsible for a range
of successful, non-regulatory voluntary programs and initiatives that reduce emissions
by creating and expanding markets for clean energy (distributed generation, renewable
energy and green power, combined heat and power, energy efficiency, energy storage
and other clean energy options). ESIB’s programs (i.e., Center for Corporate Climate
Leadership, Combined Heat and Power Partnership, Green Power Partnership) are
forging innovative public-private partnerships for addressing U.S. greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions while helping to reduce energy needs, increase energy security and
reliability, and promoting economic development. The primary goal of these programs is
o cost-effectively reduce emissions of GHG and other air emissions while providing
additional benefits to ESIB partners and other clean energy stakeholders in the form of
reduced energy costs, enhanced recognition and a smaller corporate emissions
footprint.
To achieve this goal, ESIB works to remove the barriers to investments in clean energy
hat prevent cost-effective policies, programs and projects from reaching their full
potential. ESIB partners, who also assist ESIB in addressing the policy, financing, and
programmatic barriers to broader deployment of clean energy technologies, include: the
private sector, ranging from Fortune 500 to small businesses; colleges and universities;
non-profit organizations; investor, publicly and cooperatively owned utilities; regulatory
commissions; federal, state, and local government agencies; and Native American
ribes.
ESIB programs include:
Center for Corporate Climate Leadership The Center for Corporate Climate
Leadership serves as a resource center to help organizations of all sizes
measure and manage their emissions. The Center provides: technical tools,
ground-tested guidance, educational resources, and opportunities for information
sharing and peer exchange among organizations interested in reducing their
emissions footprint. The Center supports the following activities for organizations
looking to expand their work in the areas of GHG measurement and
management: joint recognition program; supply chain emissions management;
strategic partnerships and engagements; and promotion of best practices and
echnologies in collaboration with other EPA programs and other organizations.
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Partnership The CHP Partnership is a
voluntary program to reduce the environmental impact of power generation by
promoting the use of CHP. CHP is an efficient, clean and reliable approach to
generating power and thermal energy from a single fuel source. EPA’s CHP
Partnership program works to encourage end users to evaluate and implemen
efficient CHP projects and increase knowledge of CHP systems and their
environmental and economic benefits among: state, local and federal
policymakers, state permitting authorities; and engineers, architects and the

sustainable design community. The Partnership works closely with energy users,
he CHP industry, state and local governments and other stakeholders to identify
and remove obstacles to, and raise awareness of, investments in CHP and
support the development of new projects and promote their energy,
environmental and economic benefits.
Green Power Partnership (GPP) EPA’s Green Power Partnership encourages
U.S. organizations to voluntarily use green power to reduce the environmental
impacts associated with conventional electricity use. Partners include a wide
variety of leading organizations such as Fortune 500 companies, retail and
manufacturing businesses, colleges and universities, local, state and federal
governments, and trade associations. The Green Power Partnership establishes
minimum use benchmarks usage levels and provides Partners with information
and recognition for their activities. The partnership program encourages new
non-residential electricity customers to use green power and existing Partners to
increase their market support with targeted outreach, recognition, and limited
echnical assistance as well as updating and improving credible marke
standards.
STATE AND LOCAL BRANCH (SLB) SLB works with state, local and tribal
governments to develop and implement strategies for using environmental and energy
policies and programs to integrate clean energy into a low-cost, clean, reliable energy
system that reduces emissions and addresses local priorities. Investing in energy
strategies that lower emissions can be an effective way for state, local and tribal
governments to achieve multiple goals: improving air quality and public health,
strengthening their energy systems, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving
money.
SLB’s State and Local Energy and Environment Program offers free tools, data and
echnical expertise about energy strategies, including energy efficiency, renewable
energy and other emerging technologies, to help state, local and tribal governments
achieve their environmental, energy and economic objectives. While many of these
resources were developed for state and local governments, tribes may also find them
useful. SLB’s Heat Island Reduction Program works with communities, states, public
officials, industry representatives, researchers, and others to identify opportunities for
implementation of heat island reduction strategies. SLB engages with these partners
hrough analysis, technical assistance, targeted expertise, written guidance and peer
exchange opportunities to help develop cost-effective air quality strategies, policies and
programs for state and local officials.
SLB programs include:
State and Local Energy and Environment Program
EPA’s State and Local Energy and Environment Program provide technical
assistance, analytical tools, and peer exchange opportunities to state, local, and
ribal governments. This technical assistance includes support for assessing the

options and benefits of actions to reduce emissions, such as policies and
initiatives that promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, and related clean
echnologies, and for integrating the impacts of state energy efficiency and
renewable energy policies and programs into state planning. The focus audience
for the State and Local Energy and Environment Program is state, local, and
ribal energy and environmental officials and agencies, as well as state public
utility regulators, the heat island community, and energy efficiency practitioners.
Heat Island Reduction Program EPA’s Heat Island Reduction Program works with
communities, states, public officials, industry representatives, researchers, and
others to identify opportunities for implementation of heat island reduction
strategies. SLB engages with these partners through analysis, technical
assistance, targeted expertise, written guidance and peer exchange opportunities
o help develop cost-effective air quality strategies, policies and programs for
state and local officials.
