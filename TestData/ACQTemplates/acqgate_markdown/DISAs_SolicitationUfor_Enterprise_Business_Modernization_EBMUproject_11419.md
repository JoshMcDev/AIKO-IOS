included by offerors in their written proposals, oral presentations, and
demonstrations as well as data obtained from other sources.
M.4.
M.4.1.

EVALUATION CRITERIA
Factors, Subfactors, and Elements.

M.4.1.1. General. The Government will apply the following tailored
evaluation criteria to identify the best value proposal(s). The evaluation
criteria represent key areas of importance to be considered in the source
selection decision. The elements, subfactors, and factors have been chosen to
support a meaningful discrimination between and among competing proposals.
The proposals will be evaluated against the Government’s requirements using
four factors:
- Functional
- Technical
- Management/Past Performance.
- Cost and Price.
M.4.1.2. Definitions. In order to provide insight into the Government’s
value of the factors, the following terminology is used:
- More Important.
criterion.

The criterion is greater in value than another

- Approximately Equal. The criterion is nearly the same in value as
another criterion; any difference is very slight and unimportant.
M.4.1.3. Relative Importance. Technical, Management and Past Performance are
approximately equal. Functional is more important than Technical, Managemen
or Past Performance. Each of these non-cost factors is divided into
subfactors, which may be further divided into elements. Each subfactor and/or
element within each factor is approximately equal.
Each non-cost factor
individually is more important than Cost and Price.
M.4.1.4. Risk Assessment. The Government will perform a risk assessment of
each offeror’s proposal. The proposal risk assessment focuses on the risks

and weaknesses associated with the offeror’s proposed approach. Assessment of
risk is done for all non-cost factors and identifies potential for disruption
of schedule, degradation of performance, and the need for increased Governmen
oversight as well as the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. For
any risk identified, the evaluation addresses the offeror’s proposal for
mitigating those risks and why that approach is or is not feasible.
Figure A-1 Risk Assessment Description Table
Risk
High

Low

Description
Offeror’s proposed approach is likely to cause significan
disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of
performance, and will require a high level of contractor
emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties
Offeror’s proposed approach is likely to cause a moderate
disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of
performance, and will require a medium level of contractor
emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties
Offeror’s proposed approach is likely to cause minimal or no
disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of
performance, and will require a low level of contractor emphasis
and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties

M.4.1.4.1. The risks, which will be assessed, are those associated with the
non-cost factors of the project. Risks may occur as a result of a particular
echnical approach, operational process, management plan, or as a result of
he schedule and economic impacts associated with these approaches.
M.4.1.4.2. Government risk assessments (High, Moderate or Low) will be
addressed in evaluation narratives with strengths and weaknesses and depicted
in briefings with the color ratings for each factor.
M.4.1.4.3. A risk assessment rating will be used in conjunction with the
color codes for each assessed factor. The statements within the color code
definitions reflect evaluation of how well the non-cost factors within the
proposal meets the requirements. The risk assessment rating (High, Moderate
or Low) reflects evaluation of the likelihood that the proposed approach will
actually be achieved.

o determine if the offeror has a staff that will be dedicated to the EBM
project and a management reporting structure that ensures the EBM project will
receive support from senior management.
Subfactor 2 - Quality Recognition and Certifications. Evaluate the quality
recognition and certifications held by the offeror. Emphasis is placed on
quality recognition and certifications that directly support IT functions and
operations. Evaluate offerors on documented and verified awards and
certifications such as Carnegie Mellon University - Software Engineering
Institute’s Capability Maturity Model (SEI-CMM) and SEI-CMM Integration (SEICMMI) certification level within any of the designated CMM categories. In

addition to the level of the certification, evaluate the importance and number
of different awards and certifications (i.e., ISO 9000/9001, Malcolm Baldridge
or other similar professionally-recognized industry quality certifications).
Subfactor 3 - Management Plans.

Evaluate management plans.

within the last two years or ongoing will be evaluated. The lack of relevan
past performance information will result in the assignment of a white
(neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable). Complex IT
projects managed and implemented across an enterprise will be rated higher
han projects of lesser size, scope, and complexity. The Government may
consider all relevant past performance.
Subfactor 1 - Cost Control. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to deliver a

M.5.2. Factor 5 - Cost and Price Factor.
The price evaluation will be based upon the total proposed price submitted by
each offeror for their complete solution. The Government will calculate the
otal discounted life cycle cost (DLCC) for each offeror by multiplying the
proposed price for each of the seven years by the appropriate discount rate.
The discount rates will be provided in the final RFP.
The total proposed price for each offeror will be evaluated for completeness,
reasonableness, and if deemed necessary, price realism.
Completeness: The team verifies that all solicitation requirements have been
priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in an
adequate format.
Reasonableness: Determine the reasonableness of the overall price on the
basis of adequate price competition and by comparison with the Independen
Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).
Realism: The Government may evaluate cost/price realism with regard to the
ability of the offeror to meet the EBM requirements, if the Government deems
such analysis is necessary. Results of any realism analysis may be used in

performance risk assessments and responsibility determinations. However,
proposals shall be evaluated using the criteria in the solicitation, and the
offered prices shall not be adjusted as a result of the analysis.
