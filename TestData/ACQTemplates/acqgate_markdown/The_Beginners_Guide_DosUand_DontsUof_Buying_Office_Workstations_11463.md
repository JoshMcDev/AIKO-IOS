The Beginner’s Guide, Do's and Don'ts of Buying Office Workstations
Although furniture is considered a commercial product, we cannot accurately describe office
furniture as an “off-the-shelf” product, particularly in the case of workstations.
Why? Two Primary Reasons:
1. Architects and interior designers design workstations to fit a space and to suit the
functions of employees.
2. Manufacturers create workstations out of hundreds of parts that they offer in multiple
variations and price separately within their commercial price lists.
To further complicate things, manufacturers differentiate their products in such a way tha
components are incompatible with each other and each vendor must quote their own version of
a particular design.
Here are a few tips to help buyers save time, promote efficiency, and optimize outcomes.

Specify overall workstation footprint (e.g.
6’x8’ or 48 square feet). Address heigh
generically as either standing privacy
(allowing for 62” to 68”) or seated privacy
(allowing for 48”to 52”).
Specify a uniform height across the
workstation, inclusive of all components
and ancillary pieces, if desired.
Describe storage based on usage (e.g.
must hold legal documents or 3 ring
binders)
Allow for alternatives with respect to
fabric, finish, mix of materials and
hardware.
Address electrical and data requirements
in detail.
Define project management service
requirements in detail (e.g. required
meetings, reports, etc.).
Describe building/delivery/installation
conditions in detail.
Recognize that space plans and furniture
designs are the vision of an interior
professional that vendors will implemen
differently.
Allow vendors 4-6 weeks for quotes.
Plan on 12 weeks for manufacturing and
at least 4 for installation.
F​or larger projects, design should be for
generic product by an ​MAS interior
design firm​, architect or in-house planner
before and separate from the furniture
solicitation.

Specify workstation component or
ancillary item dimensions.
Require specific panel heights.
Force unwieldy teaming arrangements by
combining too many product groupings.
Duplicate technical specifications at the
delivery order level (when using​ ​GSA
MAS​).
Over specify fabric (grade number and
durability have an inverse relationship.
Higher grade generally offers aesthetic
variety.)
Don’t view space plans, furniture designs
and similar documents as minimal
echnical requirements.
Don’t use vendor catalogs to create
designs and to set end user expectations.

As helpful as these items may be, certainly a successful furniture acquisition requires much more.
