With on-premises computing, agencies shoulder all
of the responsibility. Cloud enables the sharing of
responsibility, determined by the chosen service model.

What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the sharing of resources,
software, and information through the Internet.
Information and data are stored on physical and
virtual servers, which are maintained and controlled
by a cloud service provider (CSP). Users access
stored information on the cloud via the Internet.

The government uses the NIST SP 800-145
definition of cloud:

Advantages of cloud computing:

OnPremises

Upload your environment and
run proprietary software on it.
Also known as Hardware as a
Service (HaaS).

Platform as a
Service (PaaS):
Build

Rent pre-built application
environments with an operating
system, languages, libraries, etc.

Software as a
Service (SaaS):
Consume

Software applications for end
users come with guaranteed
maintenance, support, and
available software.

Private cloud:
• Provisioned for single-agency use
• Shared ownership, management, and operation
between agency and CSP
• Hosted on-premises or off-premises
• Initial capital expenditure for infrastructure
Community cloud:
• Provisioned for exclusive use by specific community
• Shared ownership, management, and operation
between agencies and CSP
• Hosted off-premises
Hybrid cloud:
• Combination of previous cloud models
• Agency responsibility determined by requirements
