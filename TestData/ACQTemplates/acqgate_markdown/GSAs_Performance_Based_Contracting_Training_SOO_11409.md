Statement of Objectives
Background
The mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is to
understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment and conserve
and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation’s economic,
social and environmental needs. NOAA’s mission faces new urgency given
he intensifying national needs of the environment, the economy, and
public safety. NOAA’s role in facing these challenges is to assess and
predict environmental changes, protect life and property, provide
decision makers with reliable scientific information, manage the
Nation’s living marine and coastal resources, and foster global
environmental stewardship. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
is the foundation of American environmental protection requiring Federal
agencies to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions
under which people and nature can exist in productive harmony and
fulfill the social, economic and other needs of present and future
generations of Americans. NEPA provides a mandate and framework for
Federal agencies to consider all reasonably foreseeable environmental
effects of their proposed actions and to involve and inform the public
in the decision making process. NOAA’s policies, requirements, and
procedures for complying with NEPA and the implementing regulations
issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) are delineated in
NOAA Administrative Order Series
216-6, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT.
Program Objectives
NOAA’s objective in meeting the requirements of NEPA for its own
programs is to fully integrate the environmental review process into
NOAA’s planning and decision making process; fully consider the impacts
of NOAA’s proposed actions on the quality of the human and marine
environment; involve interested and affected agencies, state and local
governments, organizations, and individuals early in NOAA’s planning and
decision making process when impacts are, or may be, expected to the
quality of the human or marine environment from implementation of
proposed NOAA actions; and conduct and document environmental reviews
and related decisions appropriately and efficiently while successfully
carrying out the mission of NOAA.
Contract Objectives.
In assessing the most advantageous use of NOAA’s resources, exper
environmental review process services must be available to the
responsible program manager for NOAA programs. Environmental review is
he process and analysis undertaken by the responsible program manager
o identify the scope of environmental issues related to a proposed
action, and to determine the necessary steps for full compliance with
NEPA, executive orders, any actions required by the CEQ, and Departmen
regulations. The objectives to be accomplished under contract tasking:

Define the environmental nature of the proposed action and location;
Guide the environmental review and decision process; initiate the
planning process as early as possible; and advise and recommend the need
for an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statemen
(EIS) decision.
Coordinating the environmental analyses with the NEPA Coordinator to
determine the best means for NEPA compliance and facilitating review and
clearance at later stages of the decision making process.
Assess the nature and intensity of the potential environmental
consequences of the action in relation to the criteria and guidance to
determine if the action requires an EA, EIS, Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement (SEIS), Categorical Exclusion (CE), of Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI);
Prepare a CE memorandum;
Prepare an EA or initiate planning for an EIS where an EIS is know to be
appropriate;
Prepare the plan and scope the relevant processes and issues for an EA,
EIS, or SEIS;
Representative NOAA Actions
A Meteorological Radar
A Satellite Control Terminal
A Marine Laboratory in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone
Management Objectives
NOAA’s objective is to accomplish its mission while leading
environmental stewardship under NEPA by considering all reasonable
foreseeable environmental effects of its actions using exper
environmental review process services provided under this contract.
Place of Performance
The place of performance will be at the contractor’s facility.
Deliverables are to be sent to the NOAA/NWS Headquarters.
Period of Performance
The period of performance for this requirement is 1 base year with 4 1year options. The base year will be from September 1, 2004 through
August 31, 2005.
