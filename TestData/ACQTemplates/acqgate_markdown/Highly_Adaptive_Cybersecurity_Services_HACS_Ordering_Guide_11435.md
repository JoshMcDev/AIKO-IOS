Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services Ordering Guide

Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS)
Special Item Number (SIN) 132-45 (legacy) / 54151HACS (new)
Ordering Procedure
Overview
In collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), GSA
developed HACS SIN to make it easier for agencies to procure quality cybersecurity services.
The HACS SIN is part of the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Information Technology and is
designed to provide government organizations with access to qualified cybersecurity vendors
and to help organizations meet IT security requirements outlined in:


OMB Memorandum 19-03, “Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies by
enhancing the High Value Asset Program”



OMB Memorandum 17-12, “Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally
Identifiable Information”



The CISO Handbook, published on https://cio.gov

The scope of the HACS SIN includes proactive and reactive cybersecurity services. Assessment
services needed for systems categorized as High Value Assets (HVA) are also within the scope
of this SIN. It includes Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVA), Security Architecture Review
(SAR), and Systems Security Engineering (SSE). Additionally, the scope of the SIN includes
services for the seven-step Risk Management Framework (RMF), and Security Operations
Center (SOC) services.


The seven-step RMF includes preparation; information security categorization; control
selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations;
and continuous monitoring. RMF activities may also include Information Security
Continuous Monitoring Assessment (ISCMA), which evaluates organization-wide ISCM
implementations, and also Federal Incident Response Evaluations (FIREs), which
assess an organization’s incident management functions.



SOC services are services such as: 24x7x365 monitoring and analysis, traffic analysis,
incident response and coordination, penetration testing, anti-virus management,
intrusion detection and prevention, and information sharing.

There are five subcategories under the HACS SIN. Vendors listed within each subcategory in
GSA eLibrary have passed a technical evaluation for that specific subcategory:
1. High Value Asset Assessments
2. Risk and Vulnerability Assessmen
3. Cyber Hun
4. Incident Response

5. Penetration Testing
Customer agencies should check the subcategories aligned with the services they need to
ensure the vendors they select are listed under the appropriate subcategory.
The HACS SIN enables GSA to provide federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governmen
entities with quick, reliable access to pre-vetted vendors poised to offer key proactive, reactive,
and remediation services before, during, and after the realization of cyber threats.

Description
HVA Assessments include Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA) which
assesses threats and vulnerabilities, determines deviations from acceptable
configurations, enterprise or local policy, assesses the level of risk, and develops
and/or recommends appropriate mitigation countermeasures in operational and
non-operational situations. The services offered in the RVA subcategory include
Network Mapping, Vulnerability Scanning, Phishing Assessment, Wireless
Assessment, Web Application Assessment, Operating System Security
Assessment (OSSA), Database Assessment, and Penetration Testing. Security
Architecture Review (SAR) evaluates a subset of the agency’s HVA security
posture to determine whether the agency has properly architected its cybersecurity
solutions and ensures that agency leadership fully understands the risks inherent in
he implemented cybersecurity solution. The SAR process utilizes in-person
interviews, documentation reviews, and leading practice evaluations of the HVA
environment and supporting systems. SAR provides a holistic analysis of how an
HVA’s individual security components integrate and operate, including how data is
protected during operations. Systems Security Engineering (SSE) identifies
security vulnerabilities and minimizes or contains risks associated with these
vulnerabilities spanning the Systems Development Life Cycle. SSE focuses on, bu
is not limited to, the following security areas: perimeter security, network security,
endpoint security, application security, physical security, and data security.
RVA assesses threats and vulnerabilities, determines deviations from acceptable
configurations, enterprise or local policy, assesses the level of risk, and develops
and/or recommends appropriate mitigation countermeasures in operational and
non-operational situations. The services offered in the RVA sub-category include
Network Mapping, Vulnerability Scanning, Phishing Assessment, Wireless
Assessment, Web Application Assessment, Operating System Security
Assessment (OSSA), Database Assessment, and Penetration Testing.
Cyber Hunt activities respond to crises or urgent situations within the pertinen
domain to mitigate immediate and potential threats. Cyber Hunts start with the
premise that threat actors known to target some organizations in a specific industry
or with specific systems are likely to also target other organizations in the same
industry or with the same systems.
Incident Response services help organizations impacted by a cybersecurity
compromise determine the extent of the incident, remove the adversary from their
systems, and restore their networks to a more secure state.
Penetration Testing is security testing in which assessors mimic real-world attacks
o identify methods for circumventing the security features of an application,

system, or network.

Benefits to Federal Agencies


The HACS SIN is available through MAS Information Technology and is a well-managed
Tier 2 Spend Under Management (SUM) vehicle, the use of which aligns with the
President's Management Agenda and OMB Memorandum 19-13 “Category
Management: Making Smarter Use of Common Contract Solutions and Practices.”

●

This SIN allows agencies to easily identify high-quality cybersecurity vendors within
various socioeconomic categories.

●

The SIN also enables rapid ordering and deployment of services using MAS Information
Technology streamlined ordering procedures that reduce procurement lead times.

●

Helpful acquisition documents, such as Request for Quote (RFQ) and Statements of
Work (SOWs) templates and samples are available on the Acquisition Gateway and the
GSA cybersecurity website http://www.gsa.gov/hacs.

●

The HACS Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) Calculation Tool is based off
of pricing from HACS Vendors. It is available on the IT Security Hallway on the
Acquisition Gateway.

●

Cybersecurity and acquisition subject matter experts (SME) are available to help with
HACS procurements. Request SME support by sending an email to
ITSecurityCM@gsa.gov.

Ordering Process for the HACS SIN on MAS Information Technology
Purchases can be made through GSA Advantage!® eBuy system, by issuing a Request for
Quote (RFQ) against the HACS SIN and allowing HACS vendors to respond to your
requirements. An RFQ may be posted to GSA’s eBuy, an electronic RFQ system that is part of
he suite of tools which complement GSA Advantage!®. The eBuy system allows ordering
activities to post an RFQ, obtain quotes, and issue orders. In general, the process below should
be followed to order HACS services.
When multiple requirements are needed, ordering activities should only select the HACS SIN
when submitting the RFQ on eBuy, and write within the solicitation document that vendors may
utilize other SINs to create a complete solution. This will ensure the responding vendors are
limited to those on the HACS SIN and have passed a technical evaluation.
State and local governments may also order from the MAS Information Technology, which has
cooperative purchasing (www.gsa.gov/stateandlocal and
https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/202285). Agencies should also comply with their
organization's respective acquisition rules.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-2, Ordering Procedures for Services
requiring an SOW. As described in the FAR, these procedures pertain to services priced
at hourly rates as established by Schedule contracts. Vendors respond to the SOW with
a quote.
2. All SOWs shall include:
a. A description of work to be performed;
b. Location of work;
c. Period of performance;
d. Deliverable schedule;
e. Applicable performance standards; and
f.

Any special requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, and special knowledge).
To the maximum extent practicable, agency requirements shall be performancebased statements (see subpart 37.6).

3. Conduct market research using the tools below:
a. GSA Advantage!® can help you find technology products and services. Browse the
industry partners catalog and/or their price lists, which will offer details such as
delivery area, environmental attributes, and warranties.

4. Draft and issue the RFQ (contains the SOW and evaluation criteria). The RFQ shall
specify the type of order (Firm Fixed Price [FFP] or Time and Materials [T&M]/Labor
Hour) and include any options and any supplemental agency clauses as applicable (e.g.,
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement [DFARS] for Department of
Defense [DoD]).
- Optional: Request a scope review through ITSecurityCM@gsa.gov.
Follow the eBuy tutorial, which will guide you through issuing an RFI or RFQ. Posting
an RFQ on eBuy is one medium for providing fair notice in accordance with FAR
8.405-2 ordering procedures for schedules.
5. Evaluate the responses you receive. For an RFI, evaluate if enough vendors exist for
adequate competition of the requirements on the SIN. If so, move forward with an RFQ.
For an RFQ, evaluate the quote. Use GSA eLibrary to investigate the industry partners
and research their detailed contract information. Use GSA eLibrary to ensure the vendor
is listed under the desired HACS SIN subcategory.
6. Make the award through a paperless contracting system, such as the Standard
Procurement System (SPS), ConWrite, and other eProcurement tools.
