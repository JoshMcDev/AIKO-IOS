cybersecurity vendors and to help organizations meet IT
security requirements outlined in:

Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies by Enhancing the
High Value Asset Program”

Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable
Information”

reactive cybersecurity services. Assessment services
needed for government High Value Assets (HVAs)
are available through this SIN and include, but are no

Security Architecture Review (SAR), and Systems
Security Engineering (SSE). The scope also encompasses
Security Operations Center (SOC) services along with
Risk Management Framework (RMF) services, which
may include Information Security Continuous Monitoring
Assessments (ISCMAs) and Federal Incident Response
Evaluations (FIREs).
There are five subcategories under the HACS SIN.
