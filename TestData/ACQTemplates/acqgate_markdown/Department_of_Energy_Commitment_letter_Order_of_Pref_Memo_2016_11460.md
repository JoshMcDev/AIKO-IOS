SUBJECT:

Requirements to Use Existing Strategic Sourcing Agreements

The purpose of this memorandum Is to provide guidance to Contracting Officers (CO) on
he requirement to consider use of existing Strategic Sourcing agreements prior to
issuing new contract. When an existing strategic sourcing agreement is not used, the
CO must include in the contract file a brief analysis of the comparative value, including
price and non-price factors, between the services and supplies offered under the source
or sources used for the purchase and the strategic sourcing agreement.
The general process for facilitating the use of strategic sourcing agreements is:
• During the acquisition advanced planning phase, COs shall ensure tha
consideration of the use of strategic sourcing is fully considered in the
acquisition strategy.
• Upon receipt of a procurement request, the CO should visit the DOE strategic
sourcing site on the DOE Strategic Sourcing webpage
(http://energy.gov/management/strategic-sourcing), and consider ordering from
applicable DOE/other Federal strategically sourced vehicles. The CO may also
check the GSA Acquisition Gateway for other opportunities.
• If an applicable strategically sourced vehicle is available, the CO shall utilize the
vehicle to attain overall best value in terms of cost and economic efficiencies
unless the CO provides written justification as noted above.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Jeff Davis at 202-287-1877, or via
email at jeff.davis@hq.doe.gov.
