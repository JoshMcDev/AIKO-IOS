TEMPLATE 4: Acquisition of Devices Plus

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial, Font color:
Auto

Template 4 is designed for the acquisition of new devices. The first choice that the
agency is required to make is what acquisition method will be used to procure new
devices. The following are a list of acquisition methods.

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial

Purchase: The purchase method of procurement gives the agency the option to issueto
issue a purchase order for the acquisition of assets and a separate purchase order for
severable services, or to issue one purchase order with a combination of assets and
services. The BPA Level maintenance agreements are usually awarded for a total of 60
months. An agency who wishes to utilize the purchase plan maintenance agreements
may award the maintenance agreement with a base plus four option years and fund the
maintenance agreement with severable funds.
Leasing: The terms of the LTOP are quoted by the contractor with financing that has
been negotiated for the full period of lease performance. The agency is liable for the
recovery of the contractor’s investment in its assets if the lease is terminated prior to the
expiration of the term. Therefore, government agencies must fund a termination liability
fee. The termination liability must be funded and is due the contractor unless funds are
not appropriated by Congress, there is a lack of bona fide need as outlined in the GSA
Schedule 36 solicitation, or the contractor’s lease is terminated for cause (failure to
perform).
Lease to Own: A lease to own agreement will allow the agency to retain ownership of
he device at the end of the term. LTOP terms are awarded in 60 to 12 month periods of
performance.
Operating Lease: Device ownership is retained by the contractor during the period of
performance of an operating lease and the device is removed by the contractor at the
end of the term. Operating Lease terms are awarded in 60 to 12 month periods of
performance.

Flat Rate: Flat rate plans are a form of leasing. Flat rate plan prices do not vary by the
volume of print output. However, the prices and terms that have been quoted for each
device are contingent on the volume bands established by the contractBlanke
Purchase Agreement terms and terms and conditions.
Cost per Copy: Cost per copy plans are a form of leasing. Cost per copy plans charge
an agency a fixed price unit for each single sided 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper outpu
from an MFD or NP.

Ordering Activity Service Level Agreements

Page 3 of 7

The following sections outline the basic Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements
hat have been incorporated into the contractPrint Management solution at the BPA
level. Any deviations from the standard SLA must be clearly explained to the Contractor,
and may or may not be subject to additional cost based on the nature of the deviation.
The SLA is the metric with which contractor performance at the task order level will be
measured.

Delivery and Installation: The Contractor shall deliver and install MFDs and NPs within
hirty (30) calendar days from the date of award of the order (or within the timeframe
specified by the ordering activity). Each MFD and NP shall be permanently marked by
he Contractor on the front frame with a unique identification/asset tracking label tha
includes, at a minimum, the model number, serial number, and a toll-free service
elephone number. As a baseline, deliveries and installations shall be conducted
Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm (local time),
excluding federal holidays (or within the hours of operation specified by the ordering
activity).
If the Contractor’s proposed delivery or installation time is not acceptable to the ordering
activity, both parties shall negotiate a mutually agreeable alternate time.
As a requirement at the orderBPA level, the Contractors can offer storage services to
he ordering activity for orders that may require a phased delivery, or that involve a
delayed start date for the performance of the order. All storage services shall be
provided at no additional cost to the ordering activity.

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial

At the time of the initial delivery, the Contractor shall provide one month’s consumable
supplies for each MFD or NP, excluding paper. The supplies will be stored by the
government.
The Contractor shall provide a substitute MFD or NP of equal or superior features and
capabilities if for any reason the original model is not available. The substitute shall be
approved by the ordering activity prior to installation. Only those devices that have been
awarded as part of this BPA can be used as substitutes.
Note: Lease times shall not restart for substitute MFDs or NPs.
If the ordering activity and facility security procedures require off-site screening of
equipment and supplies prior to delivery, those requirements should be clearly
explained to the contractor here. Specific ordering activity and building security
screening procedures should be identified prior to award. If security procedures result in
an additional cost to the Government, the Contractor shall immediately notify the task
order Contracting Officer in writing.

number, device manufacturer, model number, serial number, and placement location,
including room number, building number, office name, customer’s name and phone
number, name and job title of the individual installing the device, and the key operator’s
signature of installation approval with the date and item number of the task order.
Training: At a minimum, the Contractor shall provide training to the key operator for
each device provided at the order level. (The schedule for that training shall be
determined by the ordering activity and indentifiedidentified to the Contractor).

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial

Training shall include, at a minimum, how to operate the basic function keys of the MFD
or NP; location and procedures for installing consumable parts, such as toner, staples,
paper etc.; how to operate special features, including but not limited to duplexing,
enlargements, and reductions; multiple job queues; diagnosis and resolution of basic
device malfunctions, etc. In addition, the training shall give the key operator the
necessary knowledge to sanitize the device(s) after sensitive information has been
exposed (e.g., copied, faxed, e-mailed, scanned, or printed) or spilled.
The Contractor shall provide access to training materials that meet the initial ordering
activity’s key operator training requirements for the training of new key operators within
hirty (30) business days of order award (unless otherwise identified by the ordering
activity). Acceptable training methods include CD-ROM, web-based, and/or in-person
raining at no additional cost to the ordering activity.
Maintenance Services: For the equipment ose Device Plus or Customizable Solutions
provided with maintenance/repair agreements, the Contractor shall be responsible for
maintaining the devices at a 95% monthly availability/up-time rating. The 95% rating
shall apply to those devices not considered to be in remote or outside of the continental
United States (OCONUS) locations. Availability/up-time ratings are based on the nine
(9)-hour Government business day and industry standards.

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial

These service levels are minimums under the contractPrint Management solution.
Ordering activities are authorized to adjust these up-time ratings, as well as official
designation of required up-time ratings for remote and OCONUS locations at the task
order level.

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial

All device components are required to ensure that the up-time requirements of this
orderBPA are met shall be included in the maintenance/warranty agreement. For
devices not owned by the ordering activity, the Contractor shall replace any MFD or NP

during normal business hours from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm with respect to the time zone in
which the device is located. The identification/asset tracking label shall be clearly visible
o the end users during normal operation of the device, and shall remain so throughou
he duration of the maintenance agreement. Unless otherwise specified by the ordering
activity, the key operator will be the primary point of contact (POC) regarding preventive
maintenance, service orders, and re-ordered consumables
The Contractor shall provide maintenance and repair service to all devices that, at a
minimum, includes installation; IT and operational troubleshooting; service orders;
preventive maintenance; repairs, including parts and labor; and network connectivity
guidance throughout the term of each task order.
Any additional requirements that exist must be identified to the Contractor here.

The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, annual service orders at no charge to the
Government. The annual service orders are a preventive maintenance service for
devices covered by a maintenance agreement to ensure the devices furnished are
maintained in good working condition. Such preventive maintenance shall be in
accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and shall be equal to
maintenance provided to commercial customers for the same MFD or NP model.

Formatted: Font: (Default) Arial

For service orders placed by the ordering activity, the Contractor shall dispatch a
echnician within six (6) hours to respond to all noncritical devices requiring onsite
service (this requirement may be adjusted at the order level). Exact definition of critical
and noncritical devices must be identified here. Response time on a service order
begins when the order, if placed by phone, is received by the Contractor. Service orders
received after normal hours of operation shall begin the following business day at 8:00
am. After determining that an MFD or NP (that is not owned directly by the Government)
cannot be repaired, the Contractor shall provide a temporary device of equal or greater
capabilities within two (2) business days at no additional cost to the ordering activity.
After the service order is completed, the service technician shall notify the key operator
about whether or not service was completed satisfactory. If the original MFD or NP is
not repaired within fourteen (14) calendar days, the Contractor shall provide a
permanent replacement MFD or NP with equal or superior features and capabilities.
The Contractor shall dispatch a technician within two (2) hours for devices designated
for “critical use” requiring onsite service, at an additional cost. If a device for “critical
use” cannot be restored to its fully operational state, the Contractor shall install a
substitute device within one (1) business day of the service response, at no additional
cost to the Government. Devices for “critical use” may require maintenance on federal
holidays. The Contractor may be required to interact with personnel that provide IT help
desk support. Any adjustments to the critical devices must be identified here.

RFQ Considerations:

Page 6 of 7

Carefully consider whether the Task Order will be procured using a Performance Based
Services approach. If the Contracting Officer intends to use Performance Based
Contracting methods the Contracting Officer must consider how to implement and use a
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. A sample QASP is provided below. The Ordering
Activity may utilize a system of incentives and disincentives rather than a pass/fail
approach given their preferences.
The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer is responsible for developing the methodology
for evaluating order quotations. Some options to consider are:
•
Acceptable/Unacceptable Technical Offers that are the lowest price and meet or
exceed salient performance characteristics
•
Other technical factors are more highly valued by the government than price
