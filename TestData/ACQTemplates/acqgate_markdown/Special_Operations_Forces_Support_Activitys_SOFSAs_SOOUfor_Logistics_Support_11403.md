## STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES SUPPORT ACITIVY (SOFSA)
BACKGROUND: The SOFSA is a Government Owned – Contractor Operated (GOCO) operation located
at Blue Grass Station, Lexington, Kentucky with contractor logistics support personnel stationed wherever
requirements dictate (OCONUS and CONUS). The SOFSA operations are on an expanded schedule up to
and including 24 X 7 X 365. The SOFSA provides flexible and highly responsive logistics support services
o ensure that the equipment readiness requirements of the SOF war fighter are met.
PURPOSE: The SOFSA is the “cornerstone” for executing USSOCOM’s SO-peculiar logistics
responsibilities to joint SOF world-wide. This contract identifies the full range of logistics services
required to meet USSOCOM’s mission of supporting the SOF community. Logistics support services
focus on the nine core capabilities depicted below. Other logistics requirements will arise stemming from
he needs of the SOF community (e.g., maritime support). The contractor must respond to these changing
and/or expanding needs.

SHARED VALUES
A major intent of this contract is to create a “teaming” arrangement between USSOCOM and the contractor.
USSOCOM intends to structure the contract in a manner that ensures that the contractor’s goals and objectives
are in alignment with those of the SOFSA. The USSOCOM and its Contractor team will work towards having
an open, collaborative, and customer-oriented professional relationship. The values listed below are crucial to
he teaming arrangement.
Teamwork – The Government and the contractor take an active role in achieving mission and resolving
problems or challenges, with the collective and cohesive team being more powerful than either of its parts.
Continuous Improvement – The Government and the Contractor recognize the value of change in the ways
of doing business, which eliminates unnecessary processes and procedures that provide little benefit to either
party.
Open Communication – The Government and the Contractor will both encourage honest and open
communications at all levels.
Accountability – Both parties will recognize and accept commitments and choices, and are responsible to
each other for meeting commitments.
Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used
extensively to monitor the performance of this contract.
