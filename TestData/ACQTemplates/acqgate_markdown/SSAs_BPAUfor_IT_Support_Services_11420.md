1. There are several references to key personnel and resumes. Remember that in a PBA, there
should be very few resumes submitted (i.e., not every contractor employee is key), and the focus
should be on results;
2. There are a number of references to and reports on number of hours worked for each
contractor employee. There should be more emphasis on achieving results than tracking hours
worked in a PBA. This tends to be labor-intensive and does not provide the agency with a clearer
picture of results; and
3. There are a few references to staffing and staffing reports. In a PBA, it's up to the contractor to
provide the right people, the right labor mix, and the right number of people. As long as he
achieves results in each of the 3 principal task orders, the contractor employees involved are no
something that needs to be tracked (unless you need a particular skill, like a Microsoft-certified
engineer - you'd probably want to see proof of the certification).
