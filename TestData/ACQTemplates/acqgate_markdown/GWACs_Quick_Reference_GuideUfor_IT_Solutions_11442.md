GWACs Quick Reference Guide for Information Technology Solutions

Simplify the procurement of Information Technology (IT) solutions with GSA’s GWACs,
acquisition vehicles tailored specifically for IT services.

What are GWACs?

Who We Are

GSA’s Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts

GWACs are part of GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service’s
(FAS) Information Technology Category (ITC), whose
portfolio provides government agencies a full range of
acquisition solutions for information technology and
elecommunications goods and services. The ITC portfolio
includes multiple acquisition channels to help customer
agencies achieve their missions: IT Schedule 70, Network
Services Solutions, Strategic Solutions and GWACs.

(GWACs) allow federal agencies the opportunity
o acquire IT services-based solutions tailored
specifically to their mission requirements.
Whether you are in the market for a major systems
development project, disaster recovery and information
assurance, innovative e-Business solutions or procuring
IT services from small businesses, look no further
han GSA GWACs. GWACs save you time and money
because the contracts are already competed and
awarded. Essentially, projects become orders issued
against the existing GWAC contract, which significantly
reduces procurement lead time and enables orders to
be awarded more efficiently and effectively.
All contractors undergo a stringent source selection
process to be awarded a GWAC. This selection process
ultimately results in a “best in class” contractor pool tha
will support your task order award decision. Through
his pool of contractors, federal agencies gain access
o innovative technology solutions while meeting their
agencies’ socioeconomic goals when purchasing from
small business GWAC contractors.

GSA maintains two GWAC Centers across the country,
staffed by contracting experts in awarding and managing
IT contracts. These professionals assist customer agencies
and industry partners by performing a variety of program
support functions, including: statement of work (SOW)
reviews, training, contractual and advisory support, and
information about proper ordering procedures.
The contracting experts at the GWAC Centers help lay
he groundwork for successful technology acquisitions –
which allows federal agencies to focus their time and
energy on completing the projects key to accomplishing
heir missions.

Building Partnerships
Key to the success of any IT project is communication
between all stakeholders – the customer agency,
industry partner, and GWAC Center – and that is
exactly what is accomplished when using a GWAC.
Acquiring technology solutions through a GWAC
creates a customer-centric focus in meeting individual
IT requirements, because GWAC professionals are
engaged to ensure requirements are met by leveraging
current and emerging technologies.

New Technology
GWACs give customer agencies access to worldclass contractors offering the latest technology
innovations. The ability to assimilate new technologies
at both the contract and order level provides GWACs
with the flexibility to maintain their state-of-the-ar
echnology offerings throughout their contract life. This
attribute sets GWACs apart from traditional contrac
mechanisms.

Solutions-Based Contracts
Solutions-based means that GWACs are created to
provide comprehensive IT services including hardware,
software or other related components as part of the
IT requirement to form a total technology solution.

GWAC Contractors
The GWAC contract holders go through a competitive
source selection process to become a prime
contractor on GSA’s GWACs. In addition to offering
heir own unique solutions to customer requirements,
hey have the ability to combine their resources with
subcontractors to expand their capabilities and provide
a comprehensive solution to the customer. This
flexibility enables contractors the ability to
deliver greater value.

Accessing the GWACs
Customers wishing to use GWACs to support their IT
requirements have two options: Direct or Assisted Acquisition.
1. Direct Acquisition
Any warranted Contracting Officer from a federal agency
wishing to award an order against a GSA GWAC must receive
a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) from GSA. This
is a simple process in which GSA provides the training on the
proper use of GSA GWACs, and then issues the DPA.
The training is offered through conference call, webinar, a
self-paced online course through the Defense Acquisition
University (DAU), and onsite training, conferences and events.
