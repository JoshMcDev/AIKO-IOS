Agency Considerations in the Wake of COVID-19
Preparing for the changing environmen
❖

Starting a telework program from scratch poses challenges, but small steps could make a
big difference
➢ If your agency is already supporting teleworking -- additional licenses for supporting
solutions such as VPN and video conferences might be added quickly.

❖

Acquisition vehicles are set up for quick acquisition of teleworking equipment, such as
laptops, tablets and other hardware
➢ Although most employees have laptops today, additional hardware may be ordered.
Agencies should consider there could be delays as demand for these solutions grows
quickly.
