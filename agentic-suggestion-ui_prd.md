# Product Requirements Document: Create Agentic Suggestion UI Framework

## Document Metadata
- **Task**: Create Agentic Suggestion UI Framework  
- **Version**: Enhanced v1.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Author**: tdd-prd-architect
- **Consensus Method**: VanillaIce synthesis applied
- **Priority**: Priority 1: Agentic & Reinforcement Learning Enhancement
- **Status**: Ready to implement (core agentic features completed)

## Executive Summary

The Agentic Suggestion UI Framework represents a critical milestone in AIKO's evolution toward intelligent, user-centered government acquisition management. This framework will provide a unified, transparent interface for presenting AI-powered suggestions across all AIKO features, building upon the successfully completed core agentic infrastructure including AgenticOrchestrator, Adaptive Form Population, Workflow Prediction Engine, and Compliance Guardian.

The framework emphasizes **trust through transparency**, **progressive disclosure**, and **user agency** - essential principles for government users who require clear audit trails and explainable AI decisions. By integrating comprehensive confidence visualization, reasoning explanation, and structured feedback collection, this framework will establish AIKO as the gold standard for trustworthy AI in government contracting.

**Key Success Metric**: Achieve >70% user acceptance rate for agentic suggestions with >90% user trust scores through transparent, explainable AI interfaces.

## Consensus Enhancement Summary

This PRD has been enhanced through VanillaIce consensus validation involving 5 independent AI models (qwen3-coder, horizon-beta, o4-mini-high, kimi-k2, gemini-2.5-pro). Key improvements include:

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Added comprehensive Section 508/WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- **Quantified Performance**: Specified measurable latency thresholds and battery impact limits  
- **Security Hardening**: Added model integrity verification and prompt injection mitigation
- **Operational Readiness**: Included offline mode, rollback mechanisms, and bias audit requirements
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Addressed model drift, multi-modal conflicts, and network degradation scenarios

## Background and Context

### Project Context

- **Platform**: iOS application with SwiftUI + Swift 6 strict concurrency
- **Domain**: Government acquisition management 
- **User Base**: Government acquisition professionals, contracting officers, procurement specialists
- **Regulatory Environment**: FAR/DFARS compliance requirements, audit trail mandates

### Current Infrastructure Status
Based on Project_Tasks.md analysis, the following core agentic infrastructure is **✅ COMPLETED**:

1. **AgenticOrchestrator** - Central coordination layer for RL-based decision making with confidence thresholds and decision modes (autonomous/assisted/deferred)
2. **Adaptive Form Population** - Q-learning based form auto-population with 95% convergence rate and <25ms classification
3. **Workflow Prediction Engine** - PFSM implementation with <150ms prediction latency and multi-factor confidence scoring
4. **Compliance Guardian** - Real-time compliance monitoring with FAR/DFARS rule engine and SHAP explanations

### Research Foundation
This PRD incorporates findings from research_agentic-suggestion-ui.md (R-001-agentic-suggestion-ui), which identified key patterns for trust-building AI interfaces including progressive disclosure, contextual confidence visualization, and government-specific compliance requirements.
