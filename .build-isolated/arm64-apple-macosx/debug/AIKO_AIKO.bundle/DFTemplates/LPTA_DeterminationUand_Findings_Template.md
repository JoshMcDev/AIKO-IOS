## 4. FINDINGS

### 4.1 Well-Defined Requirements (FAR 15.101-2(a)(1))

**Finding:** The requirements for this acquisition are well-defined and include clear, measurable performance standards.

**Supporting Analysis:**
- [ ] Requirements are clearly stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of Work (SOW)
- [ ] Technical specifications are objective and measurable
- [ ] Performance standards are clearly defined with specific metrics
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are unambiguous
- [ ] Risk of requiring significant technical judgment in source selection is minimal

**Documentation:** 
- Performance Work Statement dated [Date]
- Technical specifications in Section [X] of solicitation
- [Other supporting documents]

### 4.2 Minimal Value of Proposal Differences (FAR 15.101-2(a)(2))

**Finding:** Proposal differences above the technically acceptable threshold will provide minimal value to warrant additional cost.

**Supporting Analysis:**
- [ ] The requirement is for commercial or well-established services/products
- [ ] Technical innovation is not a significant factor for this requirement
- [ ] Performance above the minimum acceptable level provides minimal additional benefit
- [ ] The Government's technical requirements represent the optimal solution
- [ ] Cost/benefit analysis supports that additional technical merit has minimal value

**Cost/Benefit Rationale:**
[Explain why paying more for technical superiority above the threshold would not provide commensurate value to the Government]

### 4.3 Expectation of Technically Acceptable Proposals at Competitive Prices (FAR 15.101-2(a)(3))

**Finding:** Based on market research, multiple technically acceptable proposals at competitive prices are expected.

**Supporting Analysis:**
