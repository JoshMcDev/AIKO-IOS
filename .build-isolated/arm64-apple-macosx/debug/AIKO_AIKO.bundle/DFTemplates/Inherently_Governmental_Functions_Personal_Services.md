## 7. DETERMINATION – INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS

### 7.1 Inherently Governmental Functions Analysis (FAR 7.503)

The requirement has been reviewed to ensure that no tasks assigned to contractor personnel constitute inherently governmental functions as defined in FAR 2.101 and detailed in FAR 7.503(c).

**Definition Review:** Inherently governmental functions are activities that are so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by Federal Government employees.

### 7.2 Prohibited Functions Assessment

**☐ Policy Development and Implementation**
- No contractors will formulate, determine, or implement policy
- No policy interpretation authority delegated to contractors
- Policy guidance will remain with Government personnel

**☐ Budget and Financial Management**
- No contractors will make or approve budget decisions
- No authority over Government funds or financial commitments
- Budget analysis and recommendations only, with Government decision authority

**☐ Command and Control Authority**
- No command authority will be exercised by contractors
- No supervisory authority over Government personnel
- No authority to direct Government operations or activities

**☐ Regulatory and Enforcement Functions**
- No regulatory interpretation or enforcement authority
- No inspection, investigation, or compliance authority
- Support functions only under Government oversight

**☐ Government Representation**
- Contractors will not represent the Government in negotiations
- No authority to make binding agreements on behalf of Government
- No authority to commit Government resources or positions

**☐ Acquisition and Contracting Functions**
- No contracting officer authority or delegation

- Advisory and support functions only

### 7.3 Specific Task Analysis

- [Note Government capability to manage and oversee]

**Risk Mitigation:**
- [Address over-reliance on contractor support]
- [Maintain Government capability and expertise]

### 7.5 Conclusion - Inherently Governmental Functions

** FINDING:** The work to be performed is **not inherently governmental** and is permissible under FAR 7.503(d).

**Supporting Analysis:**
- All decision-making authority remains with Government personnel
- Contractor functions are advisory, analytical, or supportive in nature
- Government maintains direct oversight and control
- No delegation of sovereign Government authority to contractors

## 8. DETERMINATION – PERSONAL SERVICES (FAR 37.104)

### 8.3 Government-Contractor Relationship

**Appropriate Government Actions:**

**Prohibited Government Actions:**
