## Overview

AIKO is a focused iOS productivity tool designed to revolutionize government contract management by leveraging user-chosen LLM providers for all intelligence features. With no backend cloud services, AIKO gives users complete control over their data, LLM provider choice, and costs while delivering powerful automation through a simple native interface.

**CURRENT STATUS (2025)**: In emergency functionality restoration phase following TCA cleanup. Core user-facing features were disabled and require restoration using modern SwiftUI @Observable patterns before architectural modernization can continue.

## Core Philosophy

**Let LLMs handle intelligence. Let iOS handle the interface. Let users achieve more with less effort.**

## Development Progress

### Current Status: EMERGENCY FUNCTIONALITY RESTORATION

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SITUATION**: Core functionality was lost during TCA cleanup operations.

**Currently Functional Components**:
- ‚úÖ **Backend Services**: Core Data, LLM providers, document processing 
- ‚úÖ **Platform Architecture**: Clean iOS/macOS separation maintained
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Compiles successfully with ShareButton fixes applied
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4.1-4.2**: Enhanced Image Processing and Document Scanner remain functional

**Currently DISABLED/BROKEN Components**:
- üö® **Foundation Views**: AppView, OnboardingView, SettingsView - **CRITICAL USER IMPACT**
- üö® **Business Logic Views**: AcquisitionsListView, DocumentExecutionView, SAMGovLookupView 
- üö® **Enhanced Features**: ProfileView, LLMProviderSettingsView, DocumentScannerView
- üö® **Platform UI**: iOS/macOS menu views, navigation components

**Restoration Progress** (~35% Functional):
- ‚úÖ **Restoration Planning**: TCA restoration plan integrated into project workflow
- üöß **Phase 1 - URGENT**: Foundation view restoration **IN PROGRESS**
- üö® **Phases 2-4**: **BLOCKED** until Phase 1 completion

**Impact Assessment**:
- **User Experience**: App may be largely non-functional for end users
- **Development Priority**: All architectural work paused until basic functionality restored
- **Timeline**: Restoration must complete before unified refactoring can resume

### **REVISED TIMELINE**: Restoration-First Development

**‚ö†Ô∏è UNIFIED REFACTORING PAUSED** - Must restore functionality first

### **CURRENT PRIORITY**: Functionality Restoration (Est. 2-4 weeks)
- **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 Foundation Views - AppView, OnboardingView, SettingsView restoration
- **Week 2-3**: Phase 2 Business Logic - Core user workflows restored  
- **Week 3-4**: Phase 3-4 Enhanced Features - Complete functionality restoration
- **Approach**: Migrate from disabled TCA to SwiftUI @Observable during restoration

### **FUTURE**: Unified Refactoring (After Restoration Complete)
- **Post-Restoration**: Resume 12-week unified refactoring plan
- **Modified Timeline**: AI Core Engines implementation  
- **Adjusted Goals**: 5 Core Engines architecture with restored functionality
- **Target**: Complete architectural modernization with functional app
