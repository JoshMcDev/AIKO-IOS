IT Schedule 70 FITARA Enhancement Program

About GSA’s IT Schedule 70 FITARA Enhancement Program
In 2015, Congress passed the Federal Information Technology
Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which required GSA to put in
place enterprise-wide agreements to support federal agencies in
heir acquisition of software. In 2016, the Office of Managemen
and Budget (OMB), further refined this requirement by
mandating that GSA stand up at least two governmentwide
software agreements annually, aimed at reducing costs and
bringing innovative technology to the government through GSA’s
IT Schedule 70. We offer multiple programs to help enhance
federal work environments and improve the productivity and
quality of life for employees:
GSA is developing governmentwide enterprise agreements for
multiple software solutions that support the goals of adopting
modernized cloud technologies as well as the directives laid ou
in FITARA.
GSA has already negotiated multiple new agreements with
software and hardware companies, enhancing IT Schedule
70’s ability to make it easier for government to meet FITARA
goals and drive both technology innovation and cost savings for
federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.
Newly enhanced and negotiated agreements are in place with
he following providers on IT Schedule 70:
• Adobe®

• IBM®

• HP®

• Veritas™

• Nutanix™

In support of FITARA, GSA is renegotiating IT Schedule 70
contracts and talking with large software publishers, original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and major resellers.
The program is working to drive down pricing and provide
pre-packaged software purchasing solutions that:
• Better meet the government’s IT needs
• Address key mission challenges
• Support governmentwide IT initiatives.
The modifications are not specific “transactions” or
“purchases.” They are newly negotiated offerings that provide
customer agencies with the ability to buy these packaged
functional solutions at lower price points reflective of
enterprise-level purchasing.
The implementation of the IT Schedule 70 FITARA
enhancements are driven by recent governmentwide legislation
and guidance that focus on the government “buying as one”
hrough the development of governmentwide software
agreements and the adoption of category management:
• FITARA
• OMB M-16-12
• MEGABYTE Ac

• Dell EMC®

• ServiceNow
