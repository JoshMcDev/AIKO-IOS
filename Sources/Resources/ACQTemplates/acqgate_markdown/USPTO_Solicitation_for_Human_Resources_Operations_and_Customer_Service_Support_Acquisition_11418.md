PERFORMANCE BASED INCENTIVES

B.9.1

Performance Based Price Adjustments

8

For the purposes of this solicitation, the following recommended incentive plan is provided:
The term “Speed” refers to the percentage of CLINs that are processed on time. The day or hour count begins a
he time that the contractor receives Government inputs from the USPTO and ends at the time that the contractor
provides the required document or service to the USPTO. USPTO will sample documents and services provided
by the contractor on a minimum of a quarterly basis and in accordance with the agreed Quality Assurance Plan, in
order to calculate the average speed of the contractor. The sample or measure quantity of a CLIN that is
completed within the Acceptable Quality Level for speed divided by the total sample or measure quantity of a
CLIN completed for the evaluation period will be the formula that will be used to establish Speed. This figure will
be used in calculating performance-based adjustments to the unit price for each CLIN in the contractor’s invoices
for the measured period.
The term “Error Rate” refers to percentage of CLINs provided by the contractor to the USPTO that do not mee
he Acceptable Quality Level in terms of errors for the CLIN. USPTO will sample submissions by the contractor
on a minimum of a quarterly basis and in accordance with the agreed Quality Assurance Plan in order to calculate
he error rate of the contractor. For each area of documentation or service sampled, USPTO will determine all
errors. The sample or measure quantity of a CLIN that is completed within the Acceptable Quality Level for error
divided by the total sample or measure quantity of a CLIN completed for the evaluation period will be the formula
hat will be used to establish Error Rate. This figure will be used in calculating performance-based adjustments to
he unit price for each CLIN in the contractor’s invoices for the measured period.
Prices listed in the Offeror’s proposal and subsequently incorporated via contract award will be subject to the
accepted performance based adjustments. Adjustments will be made to the unit price for each CLIN in the
contractor’s invoice for task/delivery orders in accordance with the Speed and Error Rate measurements
described above. All offerors are encouraged to provide innovative incentive solutions. The USPTO proposes the
following:
When Speed = 98% AND Error Rate is Less than 1.6-2% = contract price is paid
Positive Incentives:
When Speed = at least 98% AND Error Rate is 1-1.5% = contract price + 3% is paid
When Speed = at least 98% AND Error Rate Less than 1% = contract price + 7% is paid
Negative Incentives:
When Speed = at least 98% but Error Rate is 3.01 - 10% = contract price – 10%
When Speed = at least 98% but Error Rate is 10.01 - 25% range = contract price – 30%
When Speed = at least 98% but Error Rate is more than 25.01% = contract price – 40%
When Error Rate is less than 2%, but average speed is 95.01 – 97% on time = contract price – 10%
When Error Rate is less than 2%, but average speed is 90 – 95% on time = contract price – 40%
When Error Rate is less than 2%, but average speed is less than 90% on time = contract price – 50%

SECTION C – STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
C.1

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) anticipates award of a contract for human
resources operational and customer service support services for the Office of Human Resources (OHR), U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). The USPTO is currently located
in Crystal City, Arlington, VA but will be relocating to a new campus in Alexandria, VA at some point between late
2003 and 2005.
The OHR plays a variety of roles in supporting the USPTO’s 21st Century Strategic Plan. Human
Resources’ personnel have the opportunity to play key roles in policy formulation by recruiting, hiring, training and
compensating competent personnel throughout the life cycle of each individual employee. A primary componen
o monitoring and tracking personnel activities is maintenance of the Official Personnel Folders and other
associated filing requirements mandated by Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations. While the broad
scope of technical subject matter involved in recruiting and retaining patent and trademark professionals is
sometimes daunting, OHR has always been able to hire more than sufficient personnel and subsequently
maintain more than 30,000 personnel records per year.
The OHR is the bulwark of the USPTO, in that without OHR, USPTO would not have the ability to function
and renew the personnel pool of technical talent that USPTO requires. There are almost 7,000 current employees
in the USPTO. Proper maintenance of personnel records, namely the Official Personnel Folder (OPF); Individual
Payroll File (IPF) used to maintain employee payroll activities; Employee Performance Folder (EPF); Medical
Personnel File (MPF), and other operational files, etc., associated with incumbent personnel and proper
disposition of more than some 30,000+ personnel records are critical OHR functions.
C.2

SCOPE

This contract is to fulfill United States Patent and Trademark Office (hereinafter referred to as the USPTO)
requirements for OHR Operations Support and Customer Service. The timely and accurate handling of personnel
actions, human resources operations, and customer service must be recognized as a vital and mandatory
requirement of this contract. It is anticipated that specific requirements will change over the life of this contract.
This will result in the USPTO modifying this contract to incorporate in-scope changes. Further, given the pace of
change in information technology and the telecommunications marketplace, it is impossible to anticipate how
individual USPTO requirements will evolve over the life of the contract. Throughout the life of this agreement, the
contractor is encouraged to continuously seek ways to incorporate innovative and emerging technologies that in
he most economic and efficient manner improves systems and mission performance.
C.3

SERVICES REQUIRED

The OHR has a goal to explore measures to function most effectively in meeting OHR’s mission in
“aligning HR practices and HR systems with the objectives of the business practices” in its role as business
partners, advisors and consultants. In view of this, OHR has elected to outsource many of its operational and
customer service support functions to allow OHR to operate as strategic partners and business planners to our
customers. As such, the Contractor shall be required to provide technical advice on and perform office-wide, ongoing human resources operational and customer support services. The services are to be administered a
USPTO in Arlington and/or Alexandria, VA and scheduled to commence on or about August 21, 2003.
The Contractor shall provide experienced and qualified professional personnel to provide services to
include, but not limited to the following:

AGENCY-LEVEL PROTEST PROCEDURES

AGENCY-LEVEL PROTEST PROCEDURES LEVEL ABOVE THE CONTRACTING OFFICER (DEC 1996)
1. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of
executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to awards of procuremen
contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to administer procurementrelated directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and
Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The
Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in
he Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external
fora. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by
an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank discussions. If concerns cannot be
resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a level above
he Contracting Officer.
II. DEFINITIONS:
An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority bu
not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the
guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply.
These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102.
A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which
he period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday,
he period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the
Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period
extends to the next day on which the Department is open.
III. PROCEDURES:
a. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision
for the Department.
Protests shall be addressed to:
Jo-Anne Barnard
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer
U.S. Patent & Trademark Office
P.O. Box 1450
Arlington, VA 22313-1450
FAX No. 703-305-0995
The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency-level Protest". The
protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to
he addressee indicated below:

Mail Stop 8
P.O. Box 1450
Arlington, VA 22313-1450
(FAX Number 703-305-5907)
b. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the
protester agrees not to protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the
protester has already filed with the GAO or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be
used.
1. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time se
for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has
been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester
was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the
preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or
should have been known, whichever is earlier.
2. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Amy protests received after
hat time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all
information is provided.
3. To be complete, protests must contain the following information:
(i) the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number
(ii) the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer
(iii) a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was
prejudiced
(iv) copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statemen
(v) a request for ruling by the agency
(vi) Statement as to form of relief requested
(vii) all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protes
(viii) all information establishing the timeliness of the protes
All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. Within 14 days after the protest is
filed, the Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the
protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the protester, have been identified by
agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement process. For good cause shown, the protes
decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for issuing the written
decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will notify the protester and all interested
parties within I day of the decision to grant the extension. Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision
authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision authority's final decision will be
binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals. The protest decision authority shall
send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified mail, return
receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition
Management. Effect of protest on award and performance:
When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the
Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that:
(i) The supplies or services are urgently required,
(ii) delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or
(iii) a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government.
When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the
protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.1004, whichever is later, the Contracting
Officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including

Request For Proposal - Solicitation 52-PAPT-3-01014
## USPTO OHR OPERATIONS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT

42

any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize
contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that:
(i) contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or (ii) urgent and compelling
circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision.
IV. REMEDIES:
The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies:
(1) terminate the contract, (2) re -compete the requirement, (3) issue a new solicitation,
(4) refrain from exercising options under the contract, (5) award a contract consistent with statutes and
regulations, (6) amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the
procurement, (7) such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect.

PROHIBITION ON MULTIPLE PROPOSALS

An Offeror shall submit a maximum of one (1) fully compliant proposal in response to the solicitation. Recognizing
hat the USPTO is encouraging innovative solutions, the USPTO will only consider one solution per offeror. If an
Offeror submits more than one proposal, all proposals will be returned without evaluation since the USPTO would
have no basis upon which to determine which of the proposals the Offeror desired to have evaluated.
L.12

EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

The USPTO will evaluate proposals and make an award in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in
Section M of the RFP.
L.13

AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS

In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without
discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal
should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the
right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer
determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number a
which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the
competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated
proposals.
L.14

NEWS RELEASES

Offerors shall make no news releases pertaining to the solicitation or subsequent contract award without prior
agency approvals and then only in coordination with the Contracting Officer.
L.15

INCURRING COSTS

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1

“BEST VALUE” DETERMINATION AND CONTRACT AWARD

The USPTO will make a best value determination across all eligible proposals. In making this determination, the
USPTO is more concerned with obtaining superior quality assurance plan, management plan, key personnel
resume, past performance, and price structure features rather than with making an award at the lowest overall
price to the USPTO. However, the USPTO will not award a contract at a significantly higher overall price to
achieve slightly superior quality assurance plan, management plan, key personnel resume, past performance, and
price structure. Additionally, USPTO reserves the right to award a contract at a higher overall price for
significantly superior quality assurance plan, management plan, key personnel resume, past performance, and
price structure. As proposals become more equal in their quality assurance plan, management plan, key
personnel resume, past performance, and price structure the overall evaluated price increases in relative
importance.
M.2

BASIS OF CONTRACT AWARD

The basis for award of a contract as a result of the RFP will be an integrated assessment by the USPTO based on
he evaluation factors described below. Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or
formula.
Award of the contract will be made to the responsive, responsible Offeror whose proposal, including all options,
contains the combination of quality assurance plan, management plan, key personnel resume, past performance,
and price structure, and price factors offering the best overall value to the USPTO. This will be determined by
comparing differences in quality assurance plan, management plan, key personnel resume, past performance,
and price structure with differences in overall price to the USPTO. USPTO shall determine what tradeoff among
quality assurance plan, management plan, key personnel resume, past performance, and price structure promises
he greatest value to the USPTO.
To be eligible for contract award, the Offeror shall meet the following conditions:
* Determined to be responsible according to the standards of FAR Subpart 9.1. The USPTO reserves
he right to conduct a Pre-award survey IAW FAR 9.106 to verify and determine that the Offeror has the
facilities and equipment necessary to perform the contract.
* Complies with all applicable laws and regulations and agrees to terms and conditions set forth in the
solicitation.
* Proposal is prepared according to instructions set forth in the solicitation and demonstrates the Offeror's
capability to perform the scope of work required.
* Meets all needs set forth in Section C.
* Provides the best overall value to the USPTO as represented by a combination of
management/technical, past performance, and price factors.
M.3

AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS

In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without
discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial
proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Governmen
reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range
exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the
number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition
among the most highly rated proposals.

Additionally, in the conduct of its evaluation of offeror's proposal, the USPTO may use a variety of information
sources in addition to information provided by the offeror. These sources may include, but are not limited to,
echnical reports, commercial literature, and contact with present or past Government or commercial customers of
he offeror. The USPTO may use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified
by the offeror. Additionally, past performance information obtained will be used to determine offeror's
responsibility. The USPTO will examine the following elements in evaluating the offeror's Past Performance:
- Relevance of the offerors past experience; and,
- Quality of the offerors past experience and performance.
E. Price Proposal
The USPTO will evaluate the overall evaluated price for each offeror.

M.5

SINGLE AWARD

Multiple awards or awards by line item will not be made.
M.6

UNBALANCED OFFERORS

The USPTO reserves the right to reject an offer if it is materially unbalanced as to prices, and it is determined that
award of such an offer would not result in the lowest overall price to the USPTO, or may otherwise be improper.
An offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than the cost for some items and prices, which
are significantly overstated for other items.
