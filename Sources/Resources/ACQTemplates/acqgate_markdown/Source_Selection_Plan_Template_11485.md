## SOURCE SELECTION PLAN TEMPLATE
Revised 1 Aug 2016

A Source Selection Plan (SSP) is required for all best-value, negotiated, competitive acquisitions under
FAR Part 15, regardless of dollar value of the acquisition or source selection process utilized.
At a minimum, the SSP shall address the nine sections identified in the template (see DoD Source
Selection Procedures paragraph 2.2); however, the template should be otherwise tailored to clearly
represent the program or requirements and, when applicable, the particular phase of the action being
addressed.
Note on using template: Information printed in red parenthetical italics within the template must be
deleted from the final SSP before printing/obtaining signatures.

(Note: include the legend “Source Selection Information -- See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 – FOR OFFICIAL
USE ONLY” at the top and bottom of each page of the document.)

1.0 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
(Include a brief description of the requirement, a summary of the objectives, and any reference to
applicable guidance (e.g., Program Management Directive (PMD)).
2.0 ACQUISITION STRATEGY
(Provide a summary of the approved acquisition strategy as set forth in the Acquisition Strategy (DoDD
5000.01, DoDI 5000.02, AFI 63-101), Acquisition Plan (AP), Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP), or
Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP). For acquisitions between the simplified acquisition threshold and
$10M, a Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary (SASS) may be used in lieu of an AP at the discretion
of the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) or the approval authority. Include a description of how the
specific acquisition being competed fits into the entire program. Reference the approved Acquisition
Strategy/AP/LCMP/LCSP/SASS and the Market Research Report for a more detailed discussion.)
An Acquisition Strategy Panel was conducted on _______ (date).
The Acquisition Plan (or SASS, LCMP, or LCSP) was approved on _______ (date).
3.0 SOURCE SELECTION TEAM (SST)
(Source selection is accomplished by a team tailored to the unique acquisition. Describe the
organizational structure of the SST. List members and advisors by name, position and title, organization,
company affiliation (if applicable), or by functional area. After approval of the SSP, personnel
replacements/additions require SSA approval unless the SSA delegates this responsibility to the SSEB
Chairperson within the SSP).
The source selection organization chart is included as SSP Attachment 1. All individuals receiving source
selection information will sign a Non-disclosure Agreement and a Conflict of Interest statement, and any
actual or potential conflict of interest issues will be resolved prior to granting access to any source
selection information as required by DoD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 1.4.1.2.6. (Address the
process and timing for execution of the Non-disclosure Agreements (NDA) and Conflict of Interes
statements, resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interest, etc.)
3.1. Source Selection Authority (SSA)
____________________ (name and office symbol) is the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for this
acquisition. (If SSA has been delegated, reference the delegation letter and date.)
(NOTE: Insert paragraphs 3.2 and/or 3.3 as appropriate for your source selection and renumber as
needed. Tailor the membership for your acquisition.)
3.2. Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC)
The SSAC will be chaired by ______________ (name). SSP Attachment 2 lists the recommended
members of the SSAC.
(NOTE: If not using an SSAC, delete the above text and state that an SSAC is not being used.)
3.3 Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB)

The SSEB will be chaired by _______________ (name). SSP Attachment 3 lists the recommended PCO,
eam chairperson(s) and members of the SSEB and advisors (if any). (Tailor as necessary, e.g., if using
factor and subfactor chiefs or leads).
3.4 Source Selection Team Roles and Responsibilities
Roles and responsibilities of the SSA, PCO, SSAC, and SSEB (including applicable Chairpersons,
members, Legal Counsel, and advisors) are specified in FAR 15.303 and DoD Source Selection
Procedures Section 1.4, as supplemented and as described below (delete this phrase if there will be no
roles and responsibilities beyond those specifically set forth in FAR 15.303, DoD Source Selection
Procedures, Section 1.4, and AFFARS MP5315.3, Section 1.4.)
(If additional roles and responsibilities will be performed by any SST members, describe those roles and
responsibilities. Describe and discuss the roles and responsibilities of the Program Manager and
Requirements Owner (RO) within the evaluation process (e.g., PM to serve as SSEB Chairperson, RO to
serve on the Technical Evaluation Team, etc.). If using Non-government Advisors, identify them and
discuss their roles and responsibilities within the SST during the phases of the source selection. Also
discuss the role and responsibility of Records Custodian (RC), if used.
If there is no SSAC, the SSEB Chairperson is to determine if the SSA wants the SSEB to perform a
comparative analysis of proposals and provide an award recommendation; if so, this is to be documented
in the SSP.)
4.0 COMMUNICATIONS
(Describe the process and controls for communication with industry as well as internal Government team
communication, to include the use of email during the source selection. Outline the security measures tha
will be utilized to ensure the information is protected as source selection information and that the
network(s) on which such information is stored or shared is protected from staff members or suppor
contractors outside the SST (see the definition of source selection information at FAR 2.101 and the
restrictions on disclosure of source selection information (bid or proposal information) as described in
FAR 3.104).)
In accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 1.4.2.2.6, the PCO shall serve as the
single point of contact for all solicitation-related inquiries from actual or prospective offerors.
Government personnel and support contractors (if applicable) will not engage in discussions with industry
concerning the source selection unless the PCO has authorized such discussions. In order to notify others
within the Air Force that an RFP has been released, the PCO shall send a notification announcing that the
final RFP has been issued. (Include a list of offices that will receive the notification.)
Meetings among Government personnel listed in SSP Attachments 2 and 3 concerning the source
selection will be held _______ (describe anticipated frequency (i.e., regular basis, daily, or as-needed),
he location, and security measures). These meetings will be predominantly for proposal evaluation,
documentation preparation, and decision-making.
If at any time during the course of evaluations or discussions the Government becomes aware of an error,
ambiguity, or change in the evaluation criteria or requirements, the PCO shall consult with Legal Counsel
and the SSA concerning whether it is necessary or appropriate to amend the solicitation or resolicit. If i
is necessary to change any requirements, those changes will be submitted to the SSA for approval. Any

approved requirements changes shall be reflected in the source selection documentation and solicitation or
amendments to the solicitation.
The PCO shall promptly notify the SSA of receipt of any protest at any time during the source selection.
(Discuss the types of communications that are authorized by the SSA for the source selection.)
During the source selection, exchanges with industry may include oral presentations by offerors (if
applicable) and clarifications, communications, and discussions as defined in FAR 15.306, as
supplemented. All such exchanges with industry will be documented in the contract file. Exchanges with
industry may be _______________ (i.e., written with encrypted E-Mail/facsimile and/or U.S. Postal
delivery; oral with telephonic or face-to-face meetings, etc.) and controls to preserve the integrity of the
source selection process, as described herein, shall be adhered to. Controls may include _____________
(describe types of controls to be used).
If using EZ Source insert the following: EZ Source automatically marks all output documents
(Reports and Archive Documents) with “Source Selection Information – See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 –
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” in the header of the document. In addition, EZ Source stores all
information electronically on a network that is secured by authentication and access controls. A
DD2875, System Authorization Access Request (SAAR), is required for every member of the
Source Selection Team and is signed by the SSEB Chairperson for authentication.
5.0 EVALUATION FACTORS AND SUBFACTORS
5.1 Solicitation Provisions
(Identify and describe the evaluation factors, subfactors, their relative order of importance; the
importance of all non-cost or price factors in relation to the cost or price factor; and the evaluation
process, including specific procedures and techniques, checklists, evaluation worksheets, etc., to be used
in evaluating and documenting the evaluation of proposals. Attach the relevant and most current Sections
L and M (or equivalent provisions of a non-UCF solicitation) to preclude inconsistencies between the SSP
and RFP.)
See SSP Attachment 4 “Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors,” and SSP
Attachment 5 “Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award.” These documents describe the instructions for
proposal preparation, the factors and subfactors and their relative importance, and the evaluation criteria.
(Note: Tailor the above language as appropriate for non-UCF solicitations. Recommend addressing in
his paragraph the procedures involved when changes are made to Sections L and/or M (or equivalen
provisions of a non-UCF solicitation, if applicable), and which changes require amendment of the SSP.
For example: “Changes to Section L by solicitation amendment do not require amendment of the SSP;
however, changes in Section M require amendment to the SSP and approval by the SSA before a
solicitation amendment may be issued.”)
(If using Value Adjusted Total Evaluated Price (VATEP), the decision to use or not use an affordability
cap, along with supporting rationale for the decision, shall be included in the SSP. If an affordability cap
will be used, describe how it will be evaluated and whether offerors whose proposals exceed the
affordability cap will be eligible for award.)
5.2 Evaluation Process

The SSEB will adhere to FAR 15.3, as supplemented, and the evaluation process and criteria stated in SSP
Attachment 5, Section M – Evaluation Factors for Award (or equivalent provisions of the solicitation),
during evaluation of proposals.
(Use the above statement or tailor the sample language below to discuss your evaluation criteria and
procedures.)
Technical/Risk, Past Performance, Cost or Price (tailor as appropriate; i.e., include either Cost, or
include Price), and Small Business Participation (include if including a separate Small Business
Participation factor) are the factors that will be evaluated. Evaluation results for all factors will be fully
supported by the narrative findings. The narrative findings will identify strengths, deficiencies, and
excesses (applicable to the technical factor) and weaknesses and significant weaknesses (applicable to
risk) associated with each Technical/Risk evaluation factor/subfactor, as applicable. The narrative
summary for the Past Performance factor will describe the recency, relevancy (including context of data),
and quality of past work efforts (including general trends in contractor performance and source of
information). The summary for the Cost or Price factor will assess the reasonableness of the proposed
prices (tailor as necessary for cost realism, price realism, and balance analyses: cost realism must be
addressed for cost type efforts; price realism must be addressed if required by the RFP; and balance mus
be addressed whenever the solicitation includes separately priced line items or subline items). The Small
Business Participation factor will evaluate the extent of participation of small business concerns. The
narrative summary for the Small Business Participation factor will describe the approach and
understanding of the small business objectives or requirements. (Include if evaluating Small Business
Participation as a standalone evaluation factor; do not include if Small Business Participation is being
evaluated within the technical factor or one of the technical subfactors.)
(Identify any special techniques/reviews such as Software Capability Evaluations, Demonstrations,
Manufacturing Management/Production Capability Reviews, etc., and how the results will be factored
into the evaluation. When using subfactors, they should be limited to only those that are true
discriminators. While this may add time in the upfront preparations, it will result in a quicker evaluation
and shorter overall acquisition lead time with less risk of a protest.)
(NOTE: Tailor Section 5.2.1 below depending upon which Technical Rating Evaluation methodology
(Separate Technical/Risk Rating Method or Combined Technical/Risk Rating Method) your source
selection is using.)
5.2.1. Separate Technical/Risk Ratings
Each offeror’s technical solution will be rated separately from the risk associated with their technical
approach. A color and an adjectival rating will be assigned in accordance with DoD Source Selection
Procedures paragraph 3.1.2.1.1, Table 2A to reflect the quality of the offeror’s technical solution for the
minimum performance or capability requirements (factor or subfactors, when established) through an
assessment of the strengths and deficiencies of the proposal. The separate technical risk rating will be
assigned in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 3.1.2.1.2, Table 2B to consider
he potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs (may delete “increased cost” if using a firmfixed-price type contract), degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight,
and/or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Assessment of technical risk is manifested by
he identification of weakness(es) associated with the offeror's proposed approach as it relates to
accomplishing the requirements of the solicitation. Evaluators will make an independent judgment of the
probability of success, the impact of failure, and the acceptability of the offeror’s proposed risk mitigation
solutions when assessing technical risk.

5.2.1 Technical Ratings
The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated against the Government’s minimum requirements to determine
whether the proposal is acceptable or unacceptable, using the ratings and descriptions outlined in the DoD
Source Selection Procedures, Table C-1.
5.2.1 Combined Technical/Risk Rating
A color and an adjectival rating will be assigned in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures
paragraph 3.1.2.2, Table 3, to evaluate the offeror’s proposed approach and the degree to which i
demonstrates an understanding of the requirements (factor or subfactors, when established) through an
assessment of the proposal’s strengths, deficiencies, uncertainties, weaknesses, significant weaknesses,
and excesses.
5.2.2 Past Performance
(In accordance with FAR 15.304(c)(3)(iii) and DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 2.3.4.2.2, the
PCO (after consultation with the SSA and Program Manager, if a Program Manager is assigned) can
waive the past performance evaluation by documenting the file with the reason that past performance is
not an appropriate evaluation factor for the acquisition.)
A past performance evaluation team within the SSEB will conduct a past performance evaluation tha
examines an offeror's recent and relevant past performance record to assess the government’s confidence
in the offeror’s ability to perform as proposed. The past performance evaluation will consider the
currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, general trends in
he offeror’s performance, the number and severity of problems, the effectiveness of any corrective
actions taken, and the offeror's overall performance record. This will be assessed at the Technical factor
or subfactor level and cost/price factor level (tailor to the approach being used) but rated at the Pas
Performance factor level using the Performance Confidence Assessment ratings and descriptions in DoD
Source Selection Procedures, Table 5.
(If the past performance factor is instead to be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis, substitute the
following for the above sentence:)
Past Performance will be rated on an “Acceptable” or “Unacceptable” basis at the Past Performance factor
level using the ratings in the DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table C-2.
Potential sources of performance data are Government sources such as _____________ and/or nonGovernment sources, such as __________.
(Tailor as appropriate, to include: Past performance information may be obtained through the Pas
Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the
acquisition, through Defense Contract Management Agency channels, through interviews with program
managers and Contracting Officers, or other sources known to the Government. Data from previous
source selections or contractor capability assessments should be used if the data is recent and relevant.
See DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraphs 3.1.3.2 and C.3.)
5.2.3 Small Business Evaluation Rating
The extent of participation of small business concerns as proposed in each offeror’s proposal shall be
evaluated against the Government’s small business participation objectives or requirements. A color and
adjectival rating will be assigned in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.4.1,

Table 6. (Describe the methodology to be used for the small business participation evaluation –
evaluation as a stand-alone factor or subfactor, or within the evaluation of one of the technical
subfactors. If evaluating as a stand-alone factor or subfactor, specify whether all of the evaluation ratings
are being used as described in DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 3.1.4.1.2, or whether only
he Acceptable and Unacceptable evaluation ratings are being used as described in DoD Source Selection
Procedures paragraph 3.1.4.1.1. If evaluating within one of the technical subfactors, a separate small
business participation rating is not assigned and this paragraph must be tailored accordingly.)
5.2.4 Cost or Price
(Address the basis for evaluating cost/price (i.e., based on acquisition cost, total evaluated price,
probable cost, etc.). Per FAR 15.305(a)(1): "Normally, competition establishes price reasonableness.
Therefore, when contracting on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis,
comparison of the proposed prices will usually satisfy the requirement to perform a price analysis, and a
cost analysis need not be performed. In limited situations, a cost analysis may be appropriate to establish
reasonableness of the otherwise successful offeror's price. When contracting on a cost-reimbursemen
basis, evaluations shall include a cost realism analysis to determine what the Government should
realistically expect to pay for the proposed effort, the offeror's understanding of the work, and the
offeror's ability to perform the contract. Cost realism analyses may also be used on fixed-price incentive
contracts or, in exceptional cases, on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts (see 15.404-1(d)(3)).”)
Cost/Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. (Tailor as appropriate if you will also be evaluating cos
realism (probable cost), balanced pricing for acquisitions with separately priced line items or subline
items, etc.)
5.3 Reviews and Visits
(Include only if appropriate)
Section M of the solicitation addresses whether reviews and/or plant visits will be conducted and how the
visits will be used in the evaluation process. Commonly, reviews (e.g., on-site Software Capability
Evaluation) and plant visits are conducted by the Program Manager, Lead Engineer, PCO, and Cost/Price
Analyst. These visits are usually conducted during discussions with an offeror. The results of any
reviews/visits will be briefed to the SSA during the final briefing as part of the Technical factor
evaluation.
5.4 Electronic Source Selection Procedures
(Add a paragraph identifying and explaining the details of any electronic source selection tools and/or
procedures that are being used, (e.g., EZ Source, electronic distribution of ENs) and training provided to
SST members on its use.)
(If using EZ Source, insert the following:) EZ Source preserves the SSEB’s independent evaluation
record upon which every SSA decision is made. Any SSEB member decision to revise their evaluation
after the SSA has decided to award without discussions or open discussions (Initial Evaluation Briefing),
close discussions and request Final Proposal Revisions (FPR) (Pre-FPR Briefing), or to select the source
for award (Final Evaluation Briefing) will only accomplish a revision to their evaluation documentation
after consultation with the PCO, SSEB Chairperson, and the program’s Legal Counsel. If it is necessary
o revise the SSEB member’s evaluation documentation after an SSA’s decision briefing, notification to
he SSA of the changes will be accomplished as appropriate and descriptive rationale for the change will
be documented in the record. If an SSEB member wishes to change a portion of their evaluation prior to
an SSA decision, appropriate rationale is to be provided to the Team Administrator who may unlock
evaluation records after supplying the system with rationale for the unlocking of the worksheet.

6.0 DOCUMENTATION
(Documents that will be prepared during the course of the source selection will include at a minimum: an
SSEB Initial Report covering the initial evaluation (e.g., Evaluation Worksheets, Evaluation Notices),
with the SSEB Initial Report updated as necessary following responses to discussion questions; a
Competitive Range Decision Document (if conducting discussions); an SSEB Final Report (covering
evaluation of the FPRs); an SSAC Comparative Analysis Report and Award Recommendation (if there is
an SSAC) which reflects the SSAC’s consideration of the Final SSEB Report and makes the SSAC’s award
recommendation to the SSA; and in accordance with FAR 15.308, the Source Selection Decision
Document (SSDD) which reflects the SSA’s independent determination. If there is no SSAC, the SSEB
Chairperson must determine if the SSA wants the SSEB to perform the comparative analysis and provide
an award recommendation; if so, state how this comparative analysis and award recommendation will be
documented (i.e., in the SSEB Final Report, using the Comparative Analysis Report and Award
Recommendation template, or other).
(Address whether the solicitation states that the Government intends to award without discussions bu
reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary, or if the solicitation states that the
Government will conduct discussions. If the solicitation states that the Government intends to award
without discussions, but it is later determined that discussions are necessary, the PCO must document the
rationale for this decision and obtain SSA review and approval. Address this determination and the
associated documentation. Address the documentation that will be produced if awarding withou
discussions (i.e., SSEB Initial Report becomes the SSEB Final Report, SSAC will conduct the comparative
analysis and make an award recommendation, etc.) and the process that will be followed to make this
recommendation and obtain SSA approval. If discussions will definitely be conducted, include the
following, tailored as appropriate:) The SSEB Chairperson, with assistance from the SSEB members,
will document the initial evaluation of proposals against the factors and subfactors and provide
consolidated evaluation results in the SSEB Initial Report. (Address the establishment of the competitive
range (including PM consultation and SSA approval and preparation of the Competitive Range Decision
Document), issuance of evaluation notices (ENs) to offerors, evaluation of ENs and updating the SSEB
Initial Report, and further narrowing of the competitive range if determined to be appropriate.) The
SSEB Initial Report will be updated Initial Report, as necessary, following evaluation of offeror responses
o discussions and, at a minimum, prior to presentation of the pre-Final Proposal Revisions evaluation and
briefing to the SSA. After the final evaluation of proposals against the factors and subfactors is completed
and documented, the SSEB chairperson, with assistance from the SSEB members, will prepare the SSEB
Final Report for the SSAC (if used) and SSA’s analysis. The SSAC (change to SSEB if an SSAC is no
used and the SSA has specifically requested that the SSEB perform the comparative analysis, with or
without an award recommendation; the SSA’s signature on this SSP will document that request) will
perform a comparative analysis of the proposals and provide a written report with the results of tha
analysis and an award recommendation to the SSA.
The following documents will be prepared during the course of this source selection: (Identify the types of
documents that will be prepared)
(Address the process to be used for documenting briefings presented to the SSAC and/or SSA, including
discussions at the briefings, decisions made at the briefings, outcomes of the briefings, etc.)
7.0 SCHEDULE OF EVENTS
The following schedule of significant events delineates the steps that will be accomplished during this
source selection.

(List the major acquisition activities and projected completion dates. Reference DoD Source Selection
Procedures 2.1.1.3, 2.1.2.2, and 2.1.2.3 for information on the use of peer reviews, Industry Days, and
draft RFPs as significant source selection activities. The sample table below contemplates discussions
and must be specifically tailored as appropriate for your acquisition to ensure it is streamlined ye
achievable, supports proper and full compliance with source selection procedures, and meets overall
program schedules. The list of events below is not exhaustive. If you are conducting a Software
Capability Evaluation [SCE], demonstration, or in-plant review, include dates in the matrix.
If incremental proposals are received, add an event for each. If you reserve the right to award withou
discussions, consider adding an additional column to indicate what the schedule would be if award is
made without discussions. The dates shown are typical planning estimates only. Each Source Selection

8.0 NONGOVERNMENT ADVISORS
8.1 Nongovernment Advisors
(When considering the use of nongovernment personnel to advise in source selections, program managers
and their teams must be aware of and comply with the restrictions in FAR 9.505-4(b) and FAR 37.203(d).
These sections lay out the guidelines for use of non-Government personnel to support the source
selection, the responsibility of the program manager/head of contracting activity (HCA) to make
reasonable efforts to identify Government personnel who can support the source selection, and the
requirement for the HCA to complete a determination that no Government personnel are available before
using non-Government personnel and approve their use. This approval has been delegated to
MAJCOM/DRU and AFISRA Commanders and, within AFMC and AFSPC, to the Center Commanders.
The PCO shall ensure that the determination has been made prior to issuing the solicitation.)

Nongovernment advisors will (or “will not”) be used. (If nongovernment advisors are not applicable,
delete the remaining part of this section.) Their expertise is required to support evaluation of
___________________ (identify the functional disciplines, e.g., system engineering, integration,
configuration management, data management, quality, software capability, supportability, or test and
evaluation) concepts relative to the acquisition.
Individual and company names and company addresses of Non-government Advisors are identified a
Attachment 3.
Authority to use nongovernment personnel to assist in this source selection was granted by
(Name/Title) on
(date).
8.2 Release of Proposal Information to Nongovernment Advisors and Notification to Offerors
The release of proposal information to nongovernment advisors will be subject to the controls outlined in
DoD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 1.4.6.2. Nongovernment advisors are not permitted access
o offeror’s past performance information (FAR 42.1503(d)); however, in order to make technical
judgments, they are permitted access to portions of an offerors proposal for which the advisor’s expertise
is required in the evaluation. A provision will be included in the solicitation to provide notice to
prospective offerors that contractor personnel will be used and the manner in which they will be used, and
provide the offeror an opportunity to object to the release of proposal information.
8.3 Prohibitions
Past performance information shall not be disclosed to Non-government Advisors. Non-governmen
Advisors are prohibited from proposal rating, ranking, voting, or recommending the selection of a source.
They must not have any financial interests with any of the offerors. Also, they are not normally
permitted to participate in oral presentations or discussions, but may attend if requested by the
chairperson(s). Non-government Advisors are not normally permitted to participate in Governmen
decision making meetings such as SSAC or SSEB sessions or SSA briefings, unless invited by the
chairperson(s) to be present during a particular portion of the meeting when they may be called upon to
provide specific technical information. Use of non-government personnel shall be in accordance with
FAR 9.505-4(b) and FAR 37.203(d).
8.4 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)
(Contracts providing the SSEB Non-government Advisors should be reviewed by the PCO to ensure the
appropriate OCI clauses are contained in the contracts prior to appointment.)
OCI clauses are included in the contracts under which nongovernmental advisors will provide support to
his source selection. The OCI clauses require the companies and individual Non-government Advisors to
protect offeror proprietary data and Government source selection information and prohibit the companies
from otherwise participating as an offeror, a subcontractor, or as a consultant to an offeror/subcontractor
in relation to this acquisition.
All OCI issues must be resolved before FPR request because an OCI may affect the proposed
subcontractors and thus affect the overall rating of the proposal. The Government must be able to address
hese issues in discussions, and all OCI matters must be resolved prior to award. Refer to FAR 9.506 for
further guidance.
