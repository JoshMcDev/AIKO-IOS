Small Business Set-Asides for Office Furniture

While office furniture is a commodity that is often manufactured by large businesses,
here are opportunities to carve out a piece of the office furniture acquisition for small
businesses such as seating. FAR 8.405-5 states that contracting officers, at their
discretion may set aside orders or BPAs to any small business concern.
No special documentation is required if the agency is conducting a competitive
set-aside. However, if the agency is limiting the number of small business sources
considered, the agency must prepare documentation to justify the limitation.
Agencies must take the following steps to set aside an order under the Schedules
program
1. Perform market research – determine if there are small businesses capable of
performing the desired work
2. Include a statement in the RFQ for an order or BPA that will be set aside
Contractor Teaming Arrangements (CTA)
Please note that when a contractor teaming arrangement (CTA) is being utilized, all
industry members of the CTA must be small or fall within the sub-set the requirement is
set aside for - for the CTA to be eligible for that requirement.
GSA Schedules
It is also important to note that for a Multiple Award Schedule CTA, all team members
must hold a schedule contract, they each are responsible for their portion of the work,
and each member maintains privity of contract.
Non-Manufacturing Rule
Finally, a word of caution, the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) does apply to schedule
orders set aside for small business. The NMR requires that a small business performing
under a set-aside contract or order must provide the products of small business
manufacturers.
The Non-Manufacturer rule allows a small business to offer a product that it did no
manufacturer under a small business set-aside if SBA has offered a waiver. The NMR
is an ​exception​ to the standard requirement that the contractor must perform at least 50
percent of the cost of manufacturing products (not including the cost of material) on a
supply contract. In other words, it allows a contractor that is not the manufacturer to

supply products that come from a small business manufacturer located in the United
States.
The NMR only applies under a set-aside order. If the ordering activity does not restric
he order to small business (or any of the sub-categories) the NMR does not apply even
when an award is made to a small business. However, the ordering activity will receive
small business credit when awarding to a small business, just as they would for a small
business set-aside.
Office Furniture is a commodity that is commonly manufactured by large businesses
and distributed by small businesses. When an ordering activity restricts a furniture
order to small business (i.e. conducts a set-aside) under GSA Schedules, the NMR
applies to that order. This means that the items ordered must come from a small
business manufacturer unless a waiver is received. In most cases, the small business
dealers on the GSA Schedule are dealers for furniture manufactured by large
businesses. Therefore, since the small business itself is not a manufacturer of the
furniture being procured, the ordering activity must receive a waiver prior to issuing the
solicitation in order to comply with the NMR. The small business dealer is responsible
for ensuring compliance with the NMR. If the ordering activity does not restrict the
competition to small business, but awards to small business, they will receive
socio-economic credit for the order.
As the Contracting Officer applying the Non-Manufacturer Rule to your acquisition
strategy, there are some things to remember:
●

A non-manufacturer who receives a set-aside contract must agree to supply the
product of a domestic small manufacturer or processor, unless the ordering activity
receives a waiver from the SBA or a class waiver exists.

●

The contracting officer must designate the proper NAICS code and size standard.
Note that for orders placed against GSA Schedule contracts the NAICS code and size
standard will flow down from the Schedule contract to the ordering activity’s delivery
order
