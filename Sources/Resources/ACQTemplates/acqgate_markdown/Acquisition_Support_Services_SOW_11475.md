## BACKGROUND
The National Library of Medicine (NLM), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a
mission to “assist with the advancement of medical and related sciences and to aid in the
dissemination and exchange of scientific and other information important to the progress of
medicine and to the public health.” NLM collects, organizes, preserves, and disseminates the
world’s biomedical information for the good of the public. Since its founding in 1836 as the
library of the U.S. Army Surgeon General, NLM has played a pivotal role in translating
biomedical research into practice. It is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of
electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day.
Scientists, health professionals, and the public in the United States and around the globe search
he Library's online information resources more than 1 billion times each year. The Library is
open to all and has many services and resources—for scientists, health professionals,
historians, and the public. NLM has nearly 22 million books, journals, manuscripts, audiovisuals,
and other forms of medical information, making it the largest health-science library in the world.
The Office of Acquisitions is located within the Office of Administration, Office of the Director,
National Library of Medicine (NLM). The Office of Acquisitions (OA) is responsible for the
conduct of the National Library of Medicine’s acquisitions programs (both contracts and small
purchases). Acquisitions are processed under both negotiated and Simplified Acquisition
Procedures. The OA utilizes a wide variety of complex fixed priced and cost-reimbursement type
contract instruments.
