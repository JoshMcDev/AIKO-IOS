GSA Cloud Computing Acquisition
Vehicles and Services

There are multiple ways to obtain the cloud solution that
you need through GSA’s acquisition vehicles. The CESDD
will work within the category management structure to
provide information and expertise to get you to the righ
cloud acquisition solution. Through ongoing customer
and industry engagement, the CESDD provides a trusted
government source for emerging cloud technology
acquisition. For example, we offer the Email as a Service
(EaaS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) awarded
o cloud computing services vendors. This multiple
award BPA makes it easy for agencies to acquire cloud
computing service by providing:
• More price competition and lower costs through use of
ceiling pricing for explicitly defined standard services.
• Shorter procurement lead time.
• Socioeconomic credit through Federal Procuremen
Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) reporting.
• Customer-focused staff with experience in cloud
email acquisitions.
• Free scope reviews of your prospective solicitation
documents.

IT Schedule 70 (Cloud SIN 132-40): GSA provides
commercial cloud computing services through IT Schedule
70, a $15 Billion program that is the primary vehicle
hrough which federal customers can access the lates
IT services and solutions. A new Special Item Number
(SIN) has recently been added to IT Schedule 70 in order
o improve the way cloud services are delivered on IT
Schedule 70. This provides an ‘Easy to Find, Easy to Buy’
central location to research and compare prequalified
cloud services.

• Reduce IT procurement time and risk.

• Comply with Federal Policies such as OMB’s
Cloud-First policy, and The Federal Data Center
Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI)/now DCO.

GWACs: Government-wide Acquisition Contracts
(GWACs) offer cloud services as part of a total IT solution.
Alliant GWAC solutions have been successfully used for
many Cloud Computing projects including GSA’s own
agency-wide implementation of Cloud Email as a Service
(prior to EaaS BPA).

Success with Cloud
Cloud based sandboxes and test environments
reduce development time through a more efficien
collaboration.
• The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) reduced system development time from
weeks, to hours with GSA’s IaaS BPA.

Technologies

On demand services optimize IT resources by
allowing an agency to purchase only what they need.
• The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) has achieved an IT resource
utilization rate of over 60%.
• NOAA consolidated 14 email systems into one cloud
based solution.

• The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
developed and launched 10 public facing websites in
12 months, using GSA’s IaaS BPA.

Cloud solutions reduce operation and maintenance
expenses, eliminating redundant systems, and
centralizing data.

GSA offers pre-competed contracts, industry
expertise, and a wide variety of contracting tools
designed to streamline the procurement process.

• NASA realized operations and maintenance (O&M)
savings of more than 40% per year, in part by
centrally locating over 5 million documents in the
cloud.

• The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
simplified their contracting process, and ensured
imely Request for Information (RFI) responses by
using GSA BPA’s.
• DHS streamlined contracting processes by reducing
administrative costs associated with long solicitations,
as well as decreasing the time to implement, through
use of the GSA GWAC, OASIS.

• The EPA Office of Environmental Information
(OEI) utilized GSA’s IaaS BPA to implement hybrid
cloud technologies that will virtualize their National
Computing Center (NCC), with plans to move over
80% of their computing resources to the cloud.
