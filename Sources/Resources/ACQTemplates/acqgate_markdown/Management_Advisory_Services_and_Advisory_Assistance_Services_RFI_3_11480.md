DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:
The anticipated period of performance for this HHS Technical Assistance (TA) on Evaluation for
Discretionary Grant Programs effort is 1 (one) base year plus 4 (four) option years.
Background:
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency
for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those
who are least able to help themselves. Within HHS, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)
is the agency responsible for Federal programs that promote the economic and social well-being of
families, children, individuals, and communities. The Administration on Children, Youth, and Families
(ACYF) administers major federal programs that support: social services that promote positive youth
familial development and protective services and shelter for children and youth in at-risk situations.
Within ACYF, CB plans, manages, coordinates, and supports child abuse and neglect prevention and
child welfare services programs and promotes continuous improvement in the delivery of child welfare
services. CB programs are designed to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of all children.
CB programs promote the strengthening of the family unit in order to help prevent the unnecessary
separation of children from their families and support reunification of families when appropriate after
separation has occurred and to help children who are at-risk of entering foster care to reconnect with
family members.
More information about CB programs is available at: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb.
Purpose and Objectives:
The contractor is expected to assume the provision of evaluation TA to all the currently funded CB
discretionary grantees and to all grantees that will be funded during the next five years unless evaluation
TA is provided by other means, as determined in consultation with the Federal Project Officer (FPO) for
hese grants and the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for this contract. Some of the grantees
will be ending the projects during this time and others will be initiated as applications are funded in
response to new Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs).
CB publishes announcements for discretionary grant funding on an annual basis, subject to the
availability of funds. The topics, or priority areas, that are published change from year to year. The
Bureau typically funds a cluster of grants under any single priority area for a period of three to five years.
Information on CB Discretionary Grant Programs, including a list of discretionary grant awards, is
available at: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/grants/discretionary-grant.
Project Requirements
CB has a commitment to knowledge development, management, and dissemination for the benefit of the
child welfare field. This contractual effort with discretionary grantees will support CB’s objective to
identify gaps in knowledge in the field and address these, with the goal of building evidence of wha
works in child welfare. TA provided under this contract will assist CB in maximizing the developmen
and dissemination of evidence-based/informed knowledge gained from demonstration projects, and will
support the integration of knowledge developed by grantees into practice, policy, and future discretionary
activities, in order to improve or enhance child welfare practices.
Evaluation TA will include, but is not limited to, providing assistance in assessing the need to revise the
logic model and doing so; selecting project outcomes and measures; addressing IRB requirements;

training staff in collecting data and understanding the usefulness of the data; developing common data
elements across the cluster where appropriate; modifying programming in accordance with evaluation
findings, as appropriate; and reporting evaluation findings.
In providing evaluation TA, the contractor will assist grantees in attaining improved project outcomes,
strengthening evaluation findings, and determining how findings and lessons learned can be used to
improve practice and support sustainability. The contractor will interpret project evaluation results and
grantee implementation experiences, both for the use of grantees and to assist CB in identifying strategies
hat are most successful in addressing issues of importance to the child welfare field.
There are several concurrent ways that this TA effort will be conducted.
• At the beginning of each fiscal year, the contractor shall develop an annual TA delivery plan and
staffing pattern, with the agreement of the FPOs and approval of the COR.
• At the start of each new fiscal/program year, the contractor shall initiate plans for evaluation TA
activities for newly-funded grantees and update plans for TA for continuing grantees.
• The contractor will become familiar with the specific approach of each of the funded projects to
receive TA, including the design and plan for the local evaluation. Throughout the Projec
Period, the contractor will stay current with any changes of grantee plans, as well as with progress
oward project goals, and any barriers or challenges encountered by the grantees during projec
implementation and conduct of the local evaluation.
• The contractor shall have regular communication with the FPOs regarding grantees’ evaluation
activities, any significant changes in their plans, and project findings.
• TA will occur through multiple mechanisms, employed concurrently: via email, telephone,
conference calls, webinars or other electronic means, in-person, during kick-off meetings and
annual grantees meetings, and during a limited number of on-site visits to address severe
problems unable to be resolved or alleviated by TA delivered by other means.
• It is anticipated that the contractor will be providing TA to approximately 50 grantees in each of
he five fiscal years of the contract.
• Throughout the grant project period, the contractor is expected to provide ongoing TA, which will
address the identified needs to respond to common evaluation challenges. Ongoing TA will
include things such as producing updated information about projects and clusters in Grantee
Profiles, Cluster Summaries, and reports, which describe the design and conduct of local
evaluations, and the characteristics and effectiveness of project implementation.
• TA will be provided via the development of new, and the adaptation of existing, tools and
products, which are designed to support rigorous evaluation and effective implementation by
demonstration projects and to synthesize findings and lessons learned of groups of similar
discretionary grants. Products will include written syntheses, briefs, and other resources and
ools.
• TA will be targeted to individual grantees to strengthen their local evaluation so that their
projects will yield more meaningful information and higher levels of evidence on effective, new
or innovative approaches or models that would enhance child welfare practice;
• TA will be delivered to groups of grantees by identifying and examining program commonalities
within and across grant clusters. Where feasible and desired by CB, the contractor will develop
common frameworks for cross-site data collection and reporting by grantees in specific clusters,
in order to create the potential to increase the strength of grantee findings through synthesis.
• As clusters of grantees conclude their project periods, the contractor is expected to produce a
summary of the evaluation findings and implementation lessons learned by the cluster, to be
disseminated at the direction of CB. If a grants cluster has been designated to collect common
data elements, the contractor shall also prepare a summary of the cluster’s overall
accomplishments on the common data elements or cross-site evaluation, where applicable.

The contractor will work closely with the COR, FPOs, and other CB staff to plan and carry out
both targeted and general dissemination of the new knowledge developed by grantees.

Core Tasks
Core Tasks are activities in which the contractor will engage throughout the contract period. Many Core
Tasks are expected to overlap throughout the project period, while other activities may recur cyclically.
For example, the contractor will begin assessing TA needs and providing “start-up” TA for new grantees
at the beginning of each fiscal year of the contract, while simultaneously providing ongoing TA for
continuing grantees, which is relevant to their stage of project implementation.
Furthermore, the contractor is responsible for reviewing semi-annual reports and materials pertaining to
local grantee evaluations; identifying, collecting, developing and/or adapting products, tools, and
resources to meet TA needs of discretionary grantees; delivering evaluation TA at Grantees Meetings and
on-site as needed; conducting cluster-level knowledge dissemination and transfer activities related to
demonstration project evaluation findings and implementation lessons learned; and conducting cross-site
evaluation activities as directed by CB. Other Core Tasks for which the contractor is responsible include
project management activities; and communicating project progress to CB in reports and meetings.
