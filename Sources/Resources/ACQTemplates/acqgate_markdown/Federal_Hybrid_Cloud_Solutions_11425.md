8 Reasons to Implement a Federal
Hybrid Cloud Solution

Hybrid cloud implementations have been increasing in the
federal marketplace due to their flexibility, customization,
and ability to manage the balance between security and
availability. Federal agencies can utilize existing on-premise
solutions for mission critical workloads, while moving noncritical items to a public cloud.
1. Accelerate Information technology (IT) development, and
speed to market, with enhanced collaboration and virtualized
sandboxes.
2. Utilize existing IT resources, while updating operations in
phases, minimizing risks and building an agency specific
lessons learned library.

3. Customize solutions, choosing from on premise, public or
private cloud, allowing for the best available technologies for
each application and agency specific use.
4. Enjoy the flexibility and agility of public cloud solutions, while
maintaining security and ownership of data and applications.
5. Reduce IT expenses, by eliminating many in-house
operations, freeing IT departments to focus on future
innovations.
6. Increase asset utilization, by purchasing only what you need,
and maximizing what current capital expenditures.
7. Compliance with Federal and agency specific regulations
and policies.
8. Reduced cost and improved disaster recovery processes.

Model

Cloud Infrastructure Set-up

Managed by

Location

Private cloud

Used by a single organization comprising multiple
consumers (e.g., business units)

Owned, managed, and operated by the
organization

On or off premises

Community cloud

Used by a specific community of consumers
from organizations that have shared concerns
(e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and
compliance considerations)

Owned, managed, and operated by one or
more of the organizations in the community,
a third party, or some combination of them

On or off premises

Public cloud

Used by the general public

Owned, managed, and operated by a business,
academic, or government organization, or
some combination of them

On the premises of the
cloud provider

Hybrid cloud

The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain
unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability

8 Things to Know Before Starting a Federal
Hybrid Cloud Implementation
When agencies find that they cannot migrate all legacy
information technology (IT) infrastructure, applications,
or data to the cloud, hybrid cloud—a mix of on-site
computing resources and commercially provided computing
resources—may be considered.
1. Know the Mission
Ensure that the hybrid solution will support the mission of
he agency, as well as the current information technology
strategy.
2. Focus on Outcomes
Know the desired business objectives. Understand wha
security and access levels are required for end users to
accomplish agency objectives.
3. Take Inventory
It is important to document at a high level what systems,
infrastructure and data the agency owns. Evaluate wha
resources require private and which resources are suited for
public cloud. Take into account legacy systems, as well as on
premise infrastructure.
4. Focus on Culture
This is not an IT project; it will change the way the agency
administers IT. It requires training and a solid communication
plan that includes all stakeholders.

5. Choose the Right Cloud
Private cloud should not be the default.
6. Standardize the Solution
By using open technology the agency will not be locked into
one vendor or solution, allowing future flexibility. Utilizing
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
(FedRAMP) templates is a good way to ensure compliance,
while navigating from vendor to vendor.
7. Create Processes
Hybrid solutions may involve several technologies, and several
vendors. Vendor relationships may be more dynamic than
raditional IT, requiring quick on-boarding and sometimes
ermination. Always have a plan for the migration of data, in
he event that a relationship is terminated. Create a good
evaluation system to ensure that comparisons between
vendors and offerings are similar.
8. Start Small
Develop agency specific lessons learned from implementing
more manageable solutions first. This helps have successful
implementations for mission critical systems.
