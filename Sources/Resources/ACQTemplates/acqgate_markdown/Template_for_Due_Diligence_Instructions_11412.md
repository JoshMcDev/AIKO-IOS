B. Government Team Due Diligence Ground Rules.
## DUE DILIGENCE GROUND RULES
The purpose of the due diligence session is to provide contractors an opportunity to establish a
better understanding of [AGENCY’S] contracting opportunities. The due diligence session is an
informal meeting with prospective bidders in which [AGENCY] reps provide answers to
questions asked by contractors regarding a specific contracting opportunity. The intent of these
meetings is to result in proposal submissions that are totally responsive to the RFQ requirements.
The following are some guidelines and ground rules for [AGENCY] team members that will be
participating in these sessions:


BE FAMILIAR WITH THE RFQ STATEMENT OF WORK SO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE [AGENCY] IS REQUESTING THE CONTRACTOR TO DO.



TRY TO ANSWER AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE (ASSUMING
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER).



IF ASKED THE SAME QUESTION BY DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS, GIVE
THE SAME ANSWER.



DO NOT DIVULGE ANY INFORMATION FROM ONE CONTRACTOR
SESSION TO ANOTHER CONTRACTOR.



IF ONE CONTRACTOR ASKS A QUESTION (AND RECEIVES AN ANSWER)
BUT A SECOND CONTRACTOR DOES NOT ASK THE SAME QUESTION, DO
## NOT SHARE THE QUESTION AND ANSWER WITH THE SECOND
CONTRACTOR.



A CONTRACTOR CAN REQUEST TO LOOK AT DOCUMENTS,
BUT THEY CANNOT TAKE THEM AWAY (AND WE WILL NOT COPY
THEM).



GIVE ALL OFFERORS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME. THEY HAVE BEEN
TOLD THEY HAVE UP TO 90 MINUTES. THE SESSION MUST BE
CONCLUDED AT THE 90 MINUTE MARK.



IF YOU ARE ASKED WHAT YOU THINK IS THE BEST“APPROACH”? SAY, “I
DO NOT KNOW. THAT’S LEFT FOR YOU TO DECIDE”. THIS APPLIES TO
## ALL QUESTIONS ON HOW A CONTRACTOR SHOULD DEVELOP ITS
APPROACH.



IF YOU THINK THAT ANY SPECIFIC QUESTION/ANSWER IS SOMETHING
## THAT ALL CONTRACTORS WOULD HAVE TO KNOW TO FORMULATE AN
APPROACH, THEN LET THE CONTRACTING OFFICER KNOW.

OF SPECIAL NOTE: THE [AGENCY] IS NOT BOUND BY THE ANSWERS
PROVIDED DURING DUE DILIGENCE!
