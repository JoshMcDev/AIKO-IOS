C – Statement of Objectives
C.1

INTRODUCTION

C.1.1

Purpose

The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a new government-wide
electronic data collection and management information dissemination
system. The overall goals of this system are to reduce the overall cost of
data collection and to provide timely and accurate management information
by implementing a system that interoperates with agency electronic
procurement systems that report data into the Government’s central
database and other electronic commerce systems.
C.1.2

Background

Public Law 93-400 established the requirement for agencies to report data
into a federal procurement data system (FPDS). General Services
Administration is the executive agent for the operation and maintenance of
FPDS. Approximately 60 Executive Branch agencies currently report contrac
actions to the FPDS.
Now, contract and procurement transactions are reported using standard
government forms that include an increasing list of data elements. These
data are reported either interactively through a direct key interface or
hrough batch processing using a serial text file. The batch processing
requires data to pass through multiple sets of validations (bureau, agency,
FPDS). Error corrections in batch processing are time consuming and costly.
FPDS also provides a web site enabling limited public query of information
and produces ad hoc reports for the public upon request, for a fee.
Over the past 2-3 years, many agencies developed or procured electronic
contract writing systems that are now capable of machine-to-machine
interfaces. The FPDS-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) must enable more efficien
electronic data collection and reporting by providing a real-time, online data
collection facility and eventually eliminating the text batch interface through
efficient use of machine-to-machine interfaces.
C.2 Scope
The scope of this acquisition includes the following:


Provide a full range of products and services to accurately and
efficiently collect procurement and contracting data.
Page 5

GS00M02PDR0008



Section C

Validate data collected to reduce errors in submitted information.
Provide effective, timely data and reports to acquisition managers,
Congress, and the public while reducing the overall cost to the
axpayer.
Integrate data from various Government-owned sources
Define an interface standard for contracting agency contract-writing or
procurement systems.
Provide end user support.

The resulting contract will NOT include the following:
 Developing or operating electronic contract writing/ procuremen
racking systems for agencies that award contracts and feed data to
he FPDS-NG.
C.2.1

Tasks

The contractor shall provide a system or service with the performance-based
capabilities described below. Build, deploy, and maintain an open standards
infrastructure, compatible with the architecture described in Attachment J11,
capable of collecting, validating and correcting, storing, reporting, and selling
contract and procurement data. The following performance based
characteristics are the Government’s performance objectives.
A) General Requirements
Provide the capability to input and access data worldwide 24x7x365,
except for scheduled downtime.
Browser based interfaces, tutorial and/or help materials, and help desk
services shall comply with the requirements of Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
Provide three data input methods to the agencies, sub-agencies, and
contracting offices: batch transactions, real-time machine-to-machine
ransactions, and direct key entry via the Web interface. FPDS-NG
must be able to accept multiple types of input from each agency.
Maintain the standard(s) for machine-to-machine interfaces and the file
layouts for batch interfaces.
Provide methods for adding, changing, saving partially completed
entries, and deleting data described in the data dictionary.
Date and time stamp each addition, change, and/or deletion made.

Page 6

GS00M02PDR0008

Section C

Provide a method for agency systems administrators to generate
change transactions for individual or multiple selected transactions
from the FPDS-NG database.
Provide one validation process to support all input methods. FPDS-NG
will run the validation process against each submission before posting
valid data to database. Do not allow duplicate entries or transactions
o be posted to the database.
Data submitted by any input method that fails the validation rules shall
not be posted to the database. The data containing errors must be
available for correction and analysis for a time period set by the
government from time to time. Errors may be corrected using the
browser-based interface (see B below) or by submission of a corrected
record.
Provide a process for deleting records that were found to contain errors
and that were not corrected within the allowed time period.
Provide the capability for the FPDS-NG System Administrator to
override FPDS-NG validation rules upon challenge of an error notice.
Return both plain language and coded error messages to the sending
systems and to web users.
Maintain each transaction as a distinct record. Data validated and
posted to the database shall not be physically deleted or overwritten or
altered in any way except as provided in an approved quality
assurance plan.
Track the source and history of all transactions.
B) Browser Based Interfaces
Provide a web browser based interface for direct key entry, error
correction, report generation, and query capability.
Web-based interfaces shall support commonly used browsers using
HTML version 4.01 and cascading style sheets version 1, consisten
with the requirements of Section 508 without active components of
any kind (including plug-ins, JavaScript, java applets, or scripting
support), or use of persistent cookies. Documentation may be made
available in formats in addition to HTML.
Provide report and query access to all historical and curren
procurement data (see reporting requirements below).
Page 7

GS00M02PDR0008

Section C

FPDS-NG data entry screens will be standardized. However, dynamic
customization may be required to support unique agency requirements
and data variations. The intent is that, for approved variations in the
data (defined in the data dictionary), the user will see only appropriate
data entry fields and appropriate data values in lists.
Use best practices to achieve “user friendliness” which may include
he following:
Provide welcome screen(s) that include information from
registered users profile and other appropriate information.
Distinguish between mandatory and non-mandatory data fields.
Provide on-line definitions and instructions to assist users to
understand the requirement. Include the consequences of
choosing each available processing option (e.g., consequences of
pressing the “cancel” button). The definitions and instructions
should be context sensitive and explain all options applicable to
he data field.
Provide maximum user flexibility for data entry for entries no
having a list. For example, a currency field should not report an
error if the user keys a $ or a comma even though all numbers
and a period are required.
Provide a visual guide for users when there is a specific data
format requirement. For example, a ZIP Code field could have
#####-#### displayed to indicate that a 5+4 ZIP Code is
required.
Provide assistance in selecting data values such as pick list and
URL’s.
Provide the capability to automatically derive other elemen
values or limit selections based on values of higher level fields.
For example, if a user selects Virginia as the state, only Virginia
cities will appear in the city pick list.
Normally, show plain language text instead of codes,
abbreviations, or acronyms. For example, end users should be
shown state names in a pick list and after the transaction is
Page 8

GS00M02PDR0008

Section C

submitted the system will process a code (e.g., FIPS code) that
represents that state.
When user is reporting a modification of a contract, delivery
order, or purchase order, automatically display appropriate
award data which may include the following: contract number,
order number, contractor name, contractor address,
contract/order award date and description of contract/order.
When creating a new transaction, pre-populate appropriate data
fields from the user’s profile.
Provide a template capability to allow easy entry of multiple
ransactions with similar data.
Provide hyperlinks to applicable websites to retrieve legislative
and regulatory documents and hyperlinks to relevant sites.
As the first step in data entry, if the user enters transaction
identification that is already in the system (posted to the
database, found among the transactions stored in the error area,
in the suspense area), notify the user and allow the user to take
appropriate action.
Provide a suspense file for the user to store partially completed
entries. If User's connection is lost before the action is
completed, save and suspend any submitted intermediate data
so the user can continue when they reconnect. Suspended
ransactions will be deleted after four weeks.
When a transaction is successfully posted to the database or
saved in the suspense file, allow the user to print a confirmation
hat includes all the data submitted and, for a modification or
change, all the data that was changed.
Return error messages real-time and allow the user to make
corrections within the same session. Allow user to exit withou
making corrections.
Notify the user upon login of the number of suspended
ransactions and transactions with errors for which the user is
responsible. Allow the user to retrieve any of these transactions
and to work on them.

Page 9

GS00M02PDR0008

Section C

Provide a summary screen of transaction data for current action,
initial award, and all modifications or changes for preview prior to
final posting of a new transaction.
C) Machine to Machine Interface
Provide a machine-to-machine information exchange capability to
interoperate with government agency contract writing and ecommerce systems and with other e-business systems using the
standards and protocols contained in the Federal Enterprise
Architecture. (See specific interoperability requirements below.)

he Interface Specification is to provide information (technical
information, standards, and specifications) that agencies and COTS
suppliers will use to adapt their procurement systems to interoperate
with the FPDS-NG machine-to-machine.
Provide a mechanism for receiving one or more transactions in a single
data submission session.
Provide real time confirmation/acknowledgement of receipt and
processing of data. The confirmation contains a receipt of acceptance
or error messages.
Provide “web services” to support contract writing and e-commerce
systems. See attachment J8.
The contractor will define a methodology that allows FPDS-NG to
“push” changes to agency procurement systems (or agency FPDS-NG
administrators) and enables agencies to incorporate the changes with
minimal human intervention. Agencies must be able to change the
data that is collected or to change the validation rules applied to data
within 30 days following approval of the change by the governmen
change control board.
D) Batch Interfaces
Provide and maintain a single interface (that is, a single format for
each data transfer requirement) until such time as the governmen
authorizes the removal of a specific batch requirement from FPDS-NG.
Provide automated standard processes to return receipts and error
messages to agencies that submit procurement data. Agencies will be
able to choose from among the standard processes.

Page 10

GS00M02PDR0008

Section C

Provide a process to permit agencies to download their procurement
data records that contain errors.
Agencies that submit procurement data to FPDS-NG may correc
records via the browser based interface within 10 business days of the
original submission and resubmit them for validation and posting to the
database. The system must allow the agency FPDS-NG administrator
o correct an error in a single field in multiple transactions at one time.
E) Reporting and Querying
Provide an online capability for querying and reporting all the data
elements, in any format, for all data contained in FPDS-NG (e.g.,

reports. Once published, these reports do not change.
Users will have the capability to export or download formatted reports
or report data to other formats including (but not limited to) text,
HTML, Rich Text, spreadsheets, and databases.
Provide state-of-the-art data analysis technology (e.g. OLAP and/or
data mining).
Provide a method for identifying and producing standard reports similar
o those listed in Attachment J5.
Reports should allow a choice of acronyms, abbreviations, codes (and
legend) or plain language text.
For every report, provide an appendix showing selection criteria and
he meaning of the report.
Provide capability for user to schedule periodic report creation and
delivery.

any material requirement of the contract at any time, then the CO may
cancel any award-terms the contractor has earned, but that have no
commenced, and declare that the award-term incentive provisions of the
contract are void. The CO’s decision in this regard is independent of any
decision whether to terminate the contract for convenience or default.

services, or if Congress fails to appropriate funds for the services, then the
CO may cancel any award-terms that the contractor has earned, and declare
hat the award-term incentive provisions of the contract are void.
If, prior to commencement of any award-term extension, the CO determines

any award term, the CO will issue a bilateral contract modification canceling
all subsequent award-terms that the contractor has earned, and declare tha
he award-term provisions of the contract are void.

performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices have
not been established;
(iii) The portion of the total target profit (used in establishing the initial
contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this paragraph (g)) that is in
direct proportion to the supplies delivered (or services performed) and
accepted by the Government and for which final prices have not been
established-increased or decreased in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of
his clause, when the amount stated under subdivision (g)(1)(ii) of this clause
differs from the aggregate target costs of the supplies or services; and
(iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies delivered (or
services performed) and accepted by the Government (including amounts
applied or to be applied to liquidate progress payments).
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing greater
payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under subdivision (g)(1)
(iv) of this clause exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as computed in
accordance with subdivisions (g)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause, the
Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the amoun
of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this refund or
credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the Contractor under
26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or credits effected
under this clause. If any portion of the excess has been applied to the
liquidation of progress payments, then that portion may, instead of being
refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress payment account consisten
with the Progress Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide complete
details to support any claimed reductions in refunds.
(3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 45 days
after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that the Governmen

Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of the
statement submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest,
computed from the date the quarterly statement was due to the date of
repayment, at the rate established in accordance with the Interest clause.
(h) Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may provide for
payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.
(i) Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree
upon the total final price within 60 days (or within such other period as the
Contracting Officer may specify) after the date on which the data required by
paragraph (c) of this clause are to be submitted, the Contracting Officer shall
promptly issue a decision in accordance with the Disputes clause.
(j) Termination. If this contract is terminated before the total final price is
established, prices of supplies or services subject to price revision shall be
established in accordance with this clause for (1) completed supplies and
services accepted by the Government and (2) those supplies and services
not terminated under a partial termination. All other elements of the

Section I

(k) Equitable adjustment under other clauses. If an equitable adjustment in the
contract price is made under any other clause of this contract before the
otal final price is established, the adjustment shall be made in the total
arget cost and may be made in the maximum dollar limit on the total final
price, the total target profit, or both. If the adjustment is made after the total
final price is established, only the total final price shall be adjusted.
(l) Exclusion from target price and total final price. If any clause of this contrac
provides that the contract price does not or will not include an amount for a
specific purpose, then neither any target price nor the total final price
includes or will include any amount for that purpose.

hat the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at Governmen
expense, that expense shall not be included in any target price or in the total
final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.
(n) Taxes. As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or in any other
clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be included in, or excluded
from, the contract price, the term "contract price" includes the total targe
price or, if it has been established, the total final price. When any of these
clauses requires that the contract price be increased or decreased as a resul
of changes in the obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of
certain taxes or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total
arget price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that it will
not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.

A multi-year contract means a contract for the purchase of supplies or services for more than
1, but not more than 5, program years. Such contracts are issued under specific
congressional authority for specific programs. A multi-year contract may provide tha
performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is
contingent upon the appropriation of funds, and (if it does so provide) may provide for a
cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if appropriations are not made. The key
distinguishing difference between multi-year contracts and multiple year contracts is tha
multi-year contracts buy more than 1 year's requirement (of a product or service) withou
establishing and having to exercise an option for each program year after the first.

J4.1

J4 – FPDS-NG Validation

Overview of Validations

FPDS-NG will validate data reported to it. Types of validations include:
 Formatting such as verifying that dates are valid.
 Adherence to defined conventions such as the convention for a Contract Number
entered into a PIID.
 Code validation such as verifying that a Contracting Agency Code is in FIPS 95
able.
 Consistency with other data in order to enforce business rules such as If
Competitive Procedures = Simplified Acquisition Procedures, then Dollars
Obligated must be less than or equal to $5,000,000.
 Use Case specific such as if the user is entering a Modification to a PIID, then the
entered PIID must already exist in FPDS-NG.
J4.2

Guide to Validation Specification

The data elements are listed below followed by the validations that are unique to the data
element. The format include Validation Reference Number, Data Elements or Other
Information Required for the Validation, and Validation Requiremen
Some validations are complex and associated with several data elements. These are listed
separately under the heading Complex Validations.
Most validations are specific such as:
If Data Element A = N, then Data Element B must = M.
Some Validations are less specific such as:
If Contracting agency Code indicates DoD, then Data Element A must = N.
In this example, there are many Contracting Agency Codes that are DoD codes, so the
validation specification is simplified although the implementation may be complex. The
contractor is responsible for determining the best implementation.
There is no data element called Use Case or Today’s Date. Validations that reference
hese assume that the FPDS-NG knows the date and that the user interface is tracking
what the user is asking FPDS-NG to do such as Add an Award or Add a Modification.
Implementation of these pseudo-fields is the responsibility of the contractor.
The Use Case Summary defines which data elements may be entered for each use case.
Therefore, no validations are provided here to ensure that only allowable data elements
are entered.
J4.3

Agency-Specific Validations

Agency Interface Agreements will result in agency-specific validations. The Government
will work with agencies to specify agency-specific validations as part of developing the
Agency Interface Agreements.
Page 165

GS00M02PDR0008
Requirements

J4 – FPDS-NG Validation

FPDS-NG will implement agency-specific validations once an Agency Interface
Agreement is ratified. (Note: Under Alternative I, negotiating Interface Agreements
would be the responsibility of the contractor.)

J6 - Glossary

J6 – Glossary

Purpose
This glossary defines terms used in the technical documents that are
used in the FPDS-NG projects. Definitions of data elements are found
in the data dictionary.

Terms
Agency: Agency refers to one of the cabinet level departments or one
of the independent agencies, bureaus, commissions, centers, or other
organizations that report data to FPDS and/or FPDS-NG. Generally, an
agency has an independent budget and its procurement activities are
governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Agencies include all of
he cabinet level departments (Defense, Transportation, Treasury,
Education, etc.) and about 50 independent organizations (General
Services Administration, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Peace
Corps, American Battle Monuments Commission, etc.).
Agency Interface Agreements: An agreement between FPDC and
agencies.
Agency Procurement Systems: Some agencies have created
systems similar to Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) for
maintaining procurement data. The Defense Contract Action Data
System (DCADS) is one example. Agency procurement systems
capture all the data required by FPDS and may capture additional data
of specific interest to the agency. FPDS-NG may interface with these
systems to meet contract action reporting requirements automatically
and in real time.
Award: A contract for specific supplies or services. Awards obligate
funds by the government and require specific performance or delivery
by the contractor. The types of awards are Purchase Orders, StandAlone Contracts, BPA Calls, and Delivery Orders.
Batch Processing (ASCII Text): Batch is used to refer to a method
for transferring data from one computer system to another where the
data are contained in a file and processing of the data is (usually) a
separate activity and returning the results of processing the data to the
source is (again usually) a separate activity. Batch is usually no
considered a “real time” method. Some agencies provide data to the
FPDS using an ASCII text (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) data file that is generated by the agency’s procuremen
system or contract writing system. These files take unacceptable time
Page 225

GS00M02PDR0008

J6 - Glossary

and resources to process and validate. It is the goal of the FPDS-NG to
replace ASCII text files with machine-to-machine interfaces using open
standards.
Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA): A written document tha
contains terms and clauses applying to future orders, a description of
supplies or services to be provided, and methods for pricing, issuing,
and delivering orders. A BOA may be used to expedite contracting
when specific items, quantities, and prices are not known at the time
he agreement is executed.
Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA): A simplified method for
fulfilling repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing
“charge accounts” with qualified sources. A BPA may be established
under an FSS. BPAs should be established for use by an organization
responsible for providing supplies for its own operations or for other
organizations such as supply points, detached field parties, or oneperson posts.
BPA Call: An order against a BPA. In addition to the term “Call”, the
Federal Acquisition Regulation also uses the term “Purchase Order” to
refer to orders placed against a BPA, but FPDS-NG technical documents
always use the term BPA Call for this.
Browser-Based: Browser-based refers to interactions between a
person and a server using World Wide Web protocols and methods. For
he purpose of FPDS-NG, it does not include all possible methods, bu
only those associated with use of basic HTML without using any other
capabilities such as javascript, ActiveX controls, plug-ins, or applets.
The “value proposition” for FPDS-NG’s browser-based interfaces is for
solid reliability with a broad array of browsers rather than entertaining
graphics, flashy techniques, or support for “popular” features.
Business Partner Network (BPN): This is a future system that may
combine the information currently contained in the Department of
Defense’s (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Small
Business Administration’s (SBA) Procurement Marketing and Access
Network (PRO-Net) [http://pro-net.sba.gov/]. BPN would contain
additional information such as the data that is collected in the
Representations and Certifications section of solicitations. In addition
o government contractors, BPN may include grantees and governmen
agencies to facilitate a broader domain of business partners. Partners
would be responsible for maintaining their own information and
ensuring its accuracy and currency. An interim version of this system
has been known as the Integrated Vendor Profile Network (IVPN).
FPDS-NG would use the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)
Page 226

GS00M02PDR0008

J6 - Glossary

number as the key to access the BPN to retrieve contractor information
eliminating the requirement for contracting offices to submit this
information.
Central Contract Registration (CCR): CCR is the computer system
hat contains contractor information [http://www.ccr.gov/]. Use of CCR
will be mandatory for all agencies subject to the Federal Acquisition
Regulation prior to initial operations of FPDS-NG. See also Business
Partner Network.
Change: An FPDS-NG transaction that corrects data elements to make
hem consistent with an actual IDV, Award, or Modification document,
hat is, to correct an error. May also be used in special circumstances
o report a change in a data element which is not normally changeable
via a Modification transaction.
Contract Writing Systems: Some agencies have automated contrac
writing enabling contracting officers to take fewer steps when writing
contracts. Contract writing systems may automatically complete
contract forms with contract office information and vendor information
eliminating errors and saving time. Contract writing systems may
automatically select clauses and other terms and conditions when
requirements are similar to other contracts. This is particularly useful
when writing task orders, delivery orders, and BPA calls. FPDS-NG may
interface with these systems to meet contract action reporting
requirements automatically and in real time.
Delete: An FPDS-NG transaction that flags a transaction or group of
ransactions as deleted.
Delivery Order: An order for supplies or services placed against a
GWAC, IDC, FSS, or BOA. Delivery Order includes the term Task Order.
Delivery Order usually refers to an order for supplies, and Task Order
usually refers to an order for services. FPDS-NG treats them alike.
Direct Key Entry: Direct Key Entry refers to a method for collection of
data where a person keys data into a data entry form. For FPDS-NG,
direct key entry will be via browser-based forms.
Federal Acquisition Management Information System (FAMIS):
FAMIS is a name that has been used extensively to refer to the nex
generation of FPDS. It may or may not be approved for final use. See
FPDS-NG below.

Page 227

GS00M02PDR0008

J6 - Glossary

Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC): FPDC is the name of
he organization with direct operating responsibility for FPDS and FPDSNG.
Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS): The FPDS is the central
repository of statistical information on Federal contracting.
FPDS: FPDS is the predecessor of FPDS-NG. As of the date of
his glossary, FPDS is fully developed and in operation. FPDS
began collection of data in October, 1978, the beginning of fiscal
year 1979. The system contains detailed information on contrac
actions over $25,000 and summary data on procurements of less
han $25,000. The Executive departments and agencies award
over $200 billion annually for goods and services. The system
can identify who bought what, from whom, for how much, when
and where. Please see http://www.fpdc.gov/ for more
information.
FPDS-NG: FPDS – Next Generation. FPDS-NG is the successor to
he Federal Procurement Data system. As of the date of this
glossary, FPDS-NG is not yet developed or in operation. The
“official” name for this updated FPDS has not been selected. See
FAMIS above. The main improvements over the FPDS include
collecting data on most transactions, interoperability with
electronic contract systems, “real time” data collection, and “real
ime” report availability.
Federal Supply Schedule: Contract through which federal customers
can acquire commercial services and services directly from the
supplier. Either the General Services Administration (GSA) or the
Veterans Administration (VA) awards the FSS and all agencies may
purchase from them. Normally, contractors do not compete to receive
an FSS, but the government evaluates prices to ensure that they are
fair and reasonable.
Government-Wide Agency Contract (GWAC): Government-wide
contract for various information technology (IT) resources. GWACs are
awarded by one federal agency, but all other federal agencies can use
hem by placing orders through the awarding agency. Usually, vendors
form teams and compete for GWACs that are awarded to multiple
eams. GWAC programs require specific approval by the Office of
Management and Budget.
Indefinite-Delivery Contract (IDC): General category of contracts
for supplies and/or services that do not procure or specify a firm
quantity or delivery schedule and that provide for the issuance of
Page 228

GS00M02PDR0008

J6 - Glossary

orders for the delivery of supplies and/or the performance of tasks
during the period of the contract. An IDC usually limits the agencies
hat can place orders against it. An IDC may be issued to individual or
multiple contractors. The types of IDC are requirements (all of an
agency’s orders for the specified good or service go to the selected
contractor), definite-quantity (where the delivery schedule or locations
are not definite), and indefinite-quantity.
Indefinite Delivery Vehicle (IDV): A term used for FPDS-NG for a
general category of contract vehicles that do not procure specific
services or services, but provide for the issuance of orders for supplies
or services. IDVs usually obligate no funds (or very limited funds) and
never require specific performance or delivery by the contractor. The
five types of IDVs are GWAC, FSS, IDC, BPA, and BOA.
Machine-to-Machine: Machine-to-Machine refers to methods for webbased collection of or dissemination of information where a person is
not (directly) involved in the exchange of information. Instead, a
computer system initiates a communication with another computer
system, and the two systems handle all the details required to solicit a
service, provide a service, and transfer any required information.
Modification: A document that changes the terms or conditions,
exercises an option, or alters administrative data in an IDV or an
Award.
Purchase Order (PO): An offer by the Government to buy supplies or
services using simplified acquisition procedures (SAP). As used in
FPDS-NG documents, a purchase order is a stand-alone instrument (the
erm does not include orders placed under a BPA; see BPA Call). When
a PO is for $25,000 or less, FPDS-NG requires reporting of fewer data
elements. A PO is never tied to an IDV.
Real Time: Real Time is a non-technical term used by managers and
users to describe the expected response of an interface or the
expected lag time in the availability of data. In general, Real Time is
used only in a descriptive sense. When a specific requirement exists,
hat requirement is stated as a specific number of seconds, minutes,
hours, and/or days. In all other cases, the offeror/contractor is
expected to provide a “best practices” solution or the solution that is
necessary to achieve one of the specified requirements. Real Time is
not used in the sense of real time programming or imbedded systems
where responses must be received in a time frame that is critical to the
success of the system.

Page 229

GS00M02PDR0008

J6 - Glossary

Stand-Alone Contract (SAC): A contract awarded using sealed bids
or negotiation for specific supplies or services at specified costs or
prices. Simplified Acquisition Procedures were not used (see Purchase
Order). A SAC is never an order under an IDV.
User Friendly: A non-technical term that describes the reaction of a
person who is using something. For FPDS-NG the term is used to refer
o the results of a process for determining what users require and
prefer to efficiently and effectively use the system.
Void: An FPDS-NG transaction that flags a Procurement Instrumen
Identifier as unavailable for use.
Web-Based: Web-Based refers to methods for collection of or
dissemination of information using the public Internet. For the purpose
of FPDS-NG, it does not include all possible methods, but those
associated with browser-based services, machine-to-machine web
services, and batch services.
Web Service: The Federal Enterprise Architecture defines web
services as an architecture for allowing applications to discover and
access functional capabilities of other applications using Internet based
standards.

J7 - EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR'S PERFORMANCE
Each Offeror is required to request "customer survey questionnaires"
from past/current contracts to allow customers to provide pas
performance information. The responses should be transmitted directly
o the government and therefore will not be a part of the Volume I
page count, but the responses will be evaluated. Offerors shall make
good faith effort to ensure that the completed questionnaires are
received at the address in Block 7 of SF 33 not later than the date and
ime specified in Block 9 of SF 33.
The contractor may fill out the first page of this form. Only the
Contracting Officer or Representative may complete remaining pages.
Attach additional sheets as necessary.

J10 – Batch File Formats

FPDS-NG Batch Data Submission Format
FPDS-NG data that will be submitted in batch format must comply with the following standards.
1. Uses 8-bit ASCII
2. Submits all records in a standard text file (ASCII with each record terminated by an operating system
specific new line character). File must be fixed format.
3. The batch data may be delivered by FTP (File Transfer Protocol), email, or online. No floppy, CD, or
physical media will be accepted.
4. One batch data file contains records from only one system.
5. There will be an agreement between the Contracting Agency and FPDS-NG that describes the frequency
of the submission of batch data. This should be at least monthly.
6. Includes a “batch control” record as the first or last record in the file. The “batch control” record
contains the FIPS95 code for the agency submitting the data, a count of the individual record formats (i.e.,
a count for each format), and a sum of the obligated dollar field of all award and modification formats.
7. Contains one record for each transaction being reported in one of the following formats:
a) Indefinite Delivery Vehicle (Type of Record Code = “I”)
b) Award (Type of Record Code = “A”)
c) Modification (Type of Record Code = “M”)
d) Change (Type of Record Code = “C”)

J13 – Award Term Plan

J13 – Award Term Plan

1.0 Introduction
This is the basis for evaluation of the contractor’s performance and for
presenting an assessment of that performance to the Term
Determining Official (TDO). The evaluation for the number of term
points to be awarded will begin at the start of the contract.
Award-term contracting is effective when
 Performance metrics are objective,
 A long-term business relationship is of value to the
government and to the contractor, and
 The expected outcomes are known up fron
The specific criteria and procedures used for assessing the contractor’s
performance and for determining the award term earned are described
herein. All TDO decisions regarding the award-term points – including,
but not limited to, the number of points, if any; the methodology used
o calculate the points; the calculation of the points; the contractor’s
entitlement to the points; and the nature and success of the
contractor’s performance – are final and not subject to the Disputes
Clause.
The award term will be provided to the contractor through unilateral
contract modifications based upon points earned as determined by the
TDO.
2.0 Organization
The award-term organization includes the TDO and an Award-Term
Review Board (ATRB) consisting of a chairperson, the contracting
officer, a recorder, other functional area participants, advisory
members, and the performance monitors.
3.0 Responsibilities
a. Term-Determining Official. The TDO approves the award-term
plan and any significant changes to it. The TDO reviews the
recommendations of the ATRB, considers all pertinent data, and
determines the earned award-term points for each evaluation
period. The TDO appoints the ATRB chairperson.
b. Award-Term Review Board Chairperson. The ATRB chairperson
chairs the meetings of the ATRB and appoints the non254

GS00M02PDR0008

J13 – Award Term Plan

mandatory members of the board and the performance
monitors. The ATRB chairperson briefs the TDO on
recommended earned term amounts and the contractor’s overall
performance and recommends award-term plan changes to the
TDO.
c. Award-Term Review Board. ATRB members review performance
monitors’ evaluation of the contractor’s performance, consider
all information from pertinent sources, prepare interim
performance reports, and arrive at the earned award-term points
recommendation to be presented to the TDO. The ATRB will also
recommend changes to this plan. An assessment of the
contractor’s performance will be done on a yearly basis.
d. ATRB Recorder. The ATRB recorder is responsible for
coordinating the administrative actions required by the
performance monitors, the ATRB, and the TDO.
e. Contracting Officer (CO). The CO is the liaison between
contractor and government personnel. Subsequent to the TDO
decision, the CO evaluates the award-term points available and
modifies the contract period of performance, if necessary, to
reflect the decision.
f. Performance Monitors. Performance monitors maintain written
records of the contractor’s performance in their assigned
evaluation areas so that a fair and accurate evaluation is
obtained. Monitors prepare interim and end-of-period evaluation
reports as directed by the ATRB.
4.0 Award-Term Processes
a. Available Award-Term Points. The earned award-term points will
be based on the contractor’s performance during each
evaluation period. An accumulation of positive points (e.g., +50,
+75, or +100) is required for a one-year term extension, while
an accumulation of negative points (e.g., -50, -75, or –100)
results in a one-year reduction in the contract period. It is
important that the point system be tailored to the particular
acquisition.
b. Evaluation Criteria. If the CO does not give specific notice in
writing to the contractor of any change to the evaluation criteria
prior to the start of a new evaluation period, then the same
criteria listed for the preceding period will be used in the
following award-term evaluation period. Modifications to the
plan shall take effect in the next evaluation period.
c. Interim Evaluation Process. Interim evaluations will be
conducted at least every six months beginning with the date of
contract award. At the discretion of the TDO, interim
evaluations may take place more frequently, (e.g., at major
255

GS00M02PDR0008

J13 – Award Term Plan

milestones). The ATRB recorder notifies ATRB members and
performance monitors 14 calendar days before the midpoint of
he evaluation period. Performance monitors submit their
evaluation reports to the ATRB 21 calendar days after this
notification. The ATRB determines the interim evaluation results
and notifies the contractor of the strengths and weaknesses for
he current evaluation period. The CO may also issue letters a
any other time when it is deemed necessary to highlight areas of
government concern.
d. End-of-Period Evaluations. The ATRB recorder notifies ATRB
members and performance monitors 14 calendar days before
he end of the evaluation period. The contractor presents its
self-assessment to the CO within five working days after the end
of the evaluation period. This written assessment of the
contractor’s performance throughout the evaluation period may
also contain any information that could be reasonably expected
o assist the ATRB in evaluating its performance. The selfassessment may not exceed 10 pages. Performance monitors
submit their evaluation reports to the ATRB 14 calendar days
after the end of the evaluation period. The ATRB forwards
copies to the contractor. The performance monitors provide oral
presentations to the ATRB 21 days after the end of the
evaluation period. The contractor is then given an opportunity
o address the performance monitor evaluations. The ATRB
prepares its evaluation report and recommendation regarding
earned or unearned award-term points. The ATRB briefs the
evaluation report, and recommendation to the TDO within 30
calendar days after the end of the evaluation period. The TDO
determines the overall award-term points for the evaluation
period within 45 calendar days after each evaluation period.
The TDO letter informs the contractor of the earned award-term
points and the total cumulative points. Upon the accumulation
of sufficient award-term points, the CO issues a contrac
modification within 15 calendar days after the TDO’s decision is
made authorizing an award extension or reduction based on the
earned or unearned award-term points.
5.0 Award-term Plan Change Procedures
Proposed changes to the award-term plan will be bilateral. If either
party desires a change to the award-term plan and a mutual
agreement cannot be reached, the original award-term plan will
remain in effect.
6.0 Evaluation Factors for the Award Term Plan

J14- Existing FPDS Information

Background
The Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC), as a result of Public Law 93-400, has
been given the sole task of collecting, processing, and disseminating data in respect to
Federal Agency procurement process (see http://www.fpdc.gov). The data being
collected has accumulated since 1978 and grows in accordance with Federal Procuremen
Trends. This data is aggregated into a single database, the Federal Procurement Data
System (FPDS), which is queried by any number of Federal Agencies for a variety of
analytical purposes. Public Law 93-400 similarly requires that FPDS publish an annual
report, which provides a snapshot of over 60 Federal Agencies with detailed reports
included for agency contracts over $25,000 and summarized reports for agencies under
$25,000. The U.S. Government procurement activities in fiscal year 1998 totaled over 2
billion dollars. In addition, on behalf of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy
(OFPP) and serves on the Interagency Subcommittee established to assist the Policy
Advisory Board Chairman.
The FPDC processes approximately 1,000 data request annually. These requests are
issued for congress, executive agencies, the media and private sector organizations.
Request for data are expected to increase in association with Federal Procurement Trends
and are received through a distributed network.
The FPDC provides the following Government-wide Services:
X.
Processes approximately 500,000 Individual Contract Action Repor
(ICAR) records annually

XI.

Provides FPDS data quarterly to
a. Office of Federal Contract Compliance, US Department of Labor (DOL)
b. Small Business Administration (SBA), General Accounting Office (GAO),
US Department of Commerce (DOC), US Department of Defense (DOD),
Federal Supply (GSA), and GSA’s Data Warehouse Program

XII.

Provides FPDS data annually to
a. Census
b. US Trade Representative Office
c. Commercial entities for resale

XIII.
Publishes the annual Federal Procurement Report (FPR), which provides
“special’ processing to agencies, industry, and private firms

Several modifications to the FPDS are pending. The list of pending
modifications is as follows:
XIV.
ADA v. RAND - this is an active Federal court case involving
he legality of the use of minority preference programs in Federal
contracting. Depending upon the outcome of the case.
XV.
HUB Zones – Per Title IV of the SBA Reauthorization Bill, the
HUB Zones program was established to provide Federal
contracting assistance to historically underutilized business
zones. Depending upon the outcome of this program.

Relationships between Servers and Workstations
Each server is largely independent of all others. Except for having the FPDS PDC
running, there is no need to have any of the others running before booting. Some of the
servers have drive mappings to the PDC. The keyboard and mouse are shared resources
among all servers.
This is a Windows NT 4.0 network. The Default Gateway is 159.142.126.65 and the
Subnet Mask is 255.255.255.192. The FPDS workstations are running DHCP with IP
addresses being distributed by the PDC.
The PDC (in the P:\MailSystem directory) serves as an SMTP mail
sender. Any other server only needs to copy mail to the
P:\MailSystem\AutoMail directory in order for the message to be sent.
The system is based on a Fiber Distribution Data Interface (FDDI) Local
Area Network (LAN) with the following components:

Concentrator
The majority of the cables run to this box. It has a set of FDDI modules and a set of
10BaseT Ethernet modules.
## EIFO

Ethernet to FDDI switch. Primary use is to connect the FDDI segment to the GSA
LABN. Also used to connect between the Ethernet (10BaseT) and FDDI segments.
Ethernet 10BaseT to 10BaseF Transceiver

263

GS00M02PDR0008

Used to convert from 10BaseT to 10BaseF (fiber Ethernet) for the long haul connection
o the LABN (the LABN router that is our port into LABN is in a 2nd floor computer
room). This is sitting on top of the EIFO.
FDDI Optical and Copper Segmen

All of the servers are connected into at the FDDI ring using fiber optic cable. There is
only one workstation that is not connected to the FDDI ring.
Ethernet 10BaseT Segment(s)
The printers are attached to the Ethernet segment.

Wiring Configuration
The premise wiring is all category 5 unshielded twisted pair wired using
he 568-B standard. This is a “straight through” wiring standard. In
he computer room, you also use “straight through” jumpers to patch
between the patch panel and the concentrator. The above are true for
both FDDI and Ethernet cabling. On the workstation/printer end of
hings, Ethernet devices again use “straight through” cabling, but the
FDDI cables are different.

M-Evaluation Factors

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD
The Government will make an award to the responsible Offeror whose
responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government,
price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation
criteria below. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR
15.101-1 permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors
and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced
proposal or the highest technically rated proposal.
To be responsive the Offeror must address all the requirements of the
solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all
sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the
requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP is not acceptable.
The Government’s contract budget for development, implementation,
cost incentives, and performance incentives is $5.6 million; therefore
offerors should strive to offer the best technical solution within the
$5.6 million budget amount. Price/cost evaluation will focus heavily on
he realism of the proposed price/cost for the scope and nature of the
solution/services proposed.
M.2 EVALUATION CRITERIA
The contract award will be based on evaluation of the following factors:
 Technical Solution
 Program Managemen
 Corporate Past Performance and Experience
 Staffing
 Price
 Incentive Plan
M.2.1

Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are
significantly more important than cost or price . However, if technical
evaluations are close, the price evaluation will take on more
importance.
Among the technical evaluation factors, Technical Solution and
Program Management are most important and relatively equal to each
other. Past Experience is next, then Staffing.

382

GS00M02PDR0008

M-Evaluation Factors

Where applicable, information obtained in the oral presentation is of
equal importance to the written document submitted. In the even

exists that the Offeror can successfully complete the project at
he threshold level within the budget or within schedule.
Changes to the Offeror’s existing approach may be necessary in
order to achieve project requirements within the budget.
No Confidence: The Offeror’s understanding of the project and
soundness of management approach are such that extreme
doubt exists that the Offeror can successfully complete the
project at the threshold level within the budget, or within
schedule, accordingly successful performance is doubtful.

The confidence ratings in this context represent the Government’s
confidence that the program management proposed is relevant,
pertinent, applicable, and sufficient to infer that the system will be
successful meeting all its requirements, on time and within budget.
M.2.2.3

Corporate Past Performance and Experience

Corporate past performance and experience will be evaluated for the
following:
 Relevancy and applicability to the FPDS-NG requiremen
 Offeror’s ability to maintain control of cost, schedule, and quality
argets
 Responsiveness and success in resolving project issues
 Providing Performance Based solutions
 Level of Customer satisfaction
The Government’s evaluation will be made by checks with Offeror
provided references, Federal past performance data, and users known
o the evaluation team.
All sub-factors are of equal importance.
Merit Ratings: The following adjectival ratings will be used to rate the
merit portion of the sub-factors in the Corporate Past Performance and
Experience factor:




Outstanding: Greatly exceeds the minimum performance or
capability requirements of any evaluation sub-factor in a way
beneficial to the Government. There are no significant weaknesses.
Those aspects of a factor or sub-factor resulting in an “Outstanding”
rating may be incorporated into the resulting contract.
Excellent: Exceeds the minimum performance or capability
requirements of any evaluation sub-factors in a way beneficial to
he Government. There are no significant weaknesses. Those
aspects of a factor or sub-factor resulting in an “Excellen
rating may be incorporated into the resulting contract.

complete the project at the threshold level within the budget and
schedule.
Little Confidence: The Offeror’s understanding of the project and
proposed staffing are such that some doubt exists that the
Offeror can successfully complete the project at the threshold
level within the budget or within schedule. Changes to the
Offeror’s existing approach may be necessary in order to achieve

The confidence ratings in this context represent the Government’s
confidence that the staffing proposed is adequate, sufficient, and
proportionate to meet the objectives of the factor and sub-factors.
M.2.3
M.2.3.1

Business
Business Plan

The government will evaluate the effectiveness of the business plan to
meet program objectives. The ownership of the proposed solution will
be evaluated for the best value for the taxpayer.
M.2.3.2

Price

The Offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated to determine if it is
realistic, complete, and reasonable. Realism is evaluated by assessing
he compatibility of the proposed costs with the proposed scope and
effort (Most Probably Cost). Completeness is evaluated by assessing
he level of detail the Offeror provided in its cost submission for all RFP
requirements in the statement of work and technical documents and to
ensure the proposed price is inclusive of all requirements.
Reasonableness is evaluated by comparing the Offeror’s proposed
prices to prices for same or similar work.
The cost/price evaluation will be based on the entire project. Offers
hat total in excess of $5,600,000 for development and implementation
(Funding Ceiling) are unacceptable and that offer will be eliminated
from further evaluation.

M-Evaluation Factors

Unrealistically low proposed cost or price estimates may be grounds for
eliminating a proposal from competition, either on the basis that the
Offeror does not understand the requirements or the Offeror has made
an unrealistic offer.
Price will be evaluated for the following: total life cycle for
development, the base operation and maintenance period, and awardterm periods.
M.2.4

Incentive Plan

The government will evaluate the incentive plan; areas proposed for
incentives, metrics proposed for the incentives, and their overall
importance to improve system performance and schedule.

HELPFUL HINTS FROM THE SEVEN STEPS TEAM:
(1) Although this document, in Section B, gives offerors several business approaches, a
results-based contract should leave the solution to the offerors.
(2) In Section M, the evaluation factors include "staffing." Consider carefully whether
his type of information is needed to determine whether or not the offeror can deliver the
requisite results.
