has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the
Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and
maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee
where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor
will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms withou
cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and
maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage
determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount,
or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and
maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms
furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments,
and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to
meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law,
or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **
Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage and Hour Division does
not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only
upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of the
wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective
bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize
as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This
wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor
contract.
Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993, as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless
otherwise indicated. This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, at 202-783-3238, or

Page 42 of 78

VA-786-06-RP-0050
by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Copies
of specific job descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be
employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of
skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are
determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work
by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be
retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations
are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is
o be conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a
proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a
Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed
wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the
employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be
submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any
contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the
agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to
he Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See
section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via
ransmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required
o process the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should
be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed
in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is
included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or
subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

ATTACHMENT C
## PERFORMANCE OF WORK REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY
1. The purpose of this exhibit is to:
A. List the contract requirements considered most critical to acceptable contract performance.
B. Show, where applicable, the maximum allowable degree of deviation from perfect performance for each
requirement that shall be allowed by the Government before contract performance is considered
unsatisfactory.
C. Define the procedure the Government shall use in reducing the Contractor's monthly payment if satisfactory
performance is not rendered.
2. The Government's quality assurance procedures are based on actual performance of the contract and all areas will
be reviewed periodically, (e.g. weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually).
3. The criteria for acceptable and unacceptable performance are as follows:
A. Contract requirements. The criteria for requirements are the level of performance deemed acceptable to the
Government.
B. If the quality of work does not comply with the contract requirements the COTR will initiate and the
Contractor shall be required to complete a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR).
C. The CDR will require the Contractor to explain in writing why performance was unacceptable, how
performance will be returned to an acceptable level, and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the
future. The Contractor will not be paid for services not rendered in accordance with the standards set forth in this
contract.
D. If the level of performance is deemed unacceptable to the Government concurrent with two unsatisfactory
ratings, monthly payment will be reduced for unsatisfactory performance by the percentage as shown in the char
below:

## EVALUATION PLAN
For
Solicitation No: VA-786-06-RP-0050
Cemetery Maintenance
1. INTRODUCTION
a. This plan describes the method used to evaluate offerors for the subject solicitation. The
Government intends to evaluate offers and award to one offeror based on initial offers withou
discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with offerors or
ask for revised proposals.
b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all
options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer
is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall no
obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the
successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding
contract without further action by either party. Unless a written notice of withdrawal is received
before award, or offer’s specified expiration time that may accept an offer (or part of an offer),
whether or not there are negotiations.
2. BASIS OF AWARD
a. Award will be made to the responsible, lowest price, technically acceptable proposal in
accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Past performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR
15.305. Technical Capability and Past Performance will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis in
accordance with FAR 15.101-2, 15.304, and 15.305. No tradeoffs will be performed.

b. Subjective judgment on the part of the Government is implicit in the evaluation procedures. The
Government may award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror, if the low priced
offeror’s proposal does not meet the technical requirements of the solicitation . Award will be
made in the aggregate for the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed on the SF 1449
continuation pages (schedule) of the solicitation.
3. EVALUATION PROCESS
a. Upon closing of the solicitation, Evaluation Team members will review each proposal and
subjectively rate each factor in accordance with this Evaluation Plan and attached Evaluation
Checklists. This pass/fail analysis shall cover all non-price evaluation factors. If questions or
clarifications are required, each evaluator will provide the question in writing to the
Contracting Officer for review. Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals are
conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306. Requests for clarification may be issued to
enhance government understanding of Offeror proposals. Offerors shall not be permitted to
revise their proposal in response to the requests for clarification; however, corrections of a

Page 53 of 78

VA-786-06-RP-0050
minor nature may be permitted, and Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain
aspects of their proposals because the government intends to award without discussions.
b. Each evaluator shall prepare a narrative assessment of the respective factors for the proposal
evaluated. In preparing the written narrative, the evaluator must be aware that it is the
principle means available to the SSA to reach a source selection decision.
c. The evaluator must indicate in the narrative, as a minimum: the comprehensive summary of
strengths or weaknesses, the impact of any deficiencies, and rationale for the assigned rating
of each factor. Clarity and sufficient detail are key to successfully prepared narratives.
d. Evaluation Factors:

FACTOR (A), Technical Capability: This Factor consists of three sub-factors. Each sub-factor
will be evaluated IAW FAR 15101-2, 15.304 and 15.305 on a pass/fail basis. Failure in any subfactor will cause the entire proposal to fail.
SUB-FACTOR (1): Experience and training of technical service personnel: In evaluating
his sub-factor, the panel may use any combination of methods including examination of
Offeror submitted documentation (such as résumés and diplomas), site inspection of
previous projects, and person to person contact with references, the site superintendent,
and key technical personnel.
SUB-FACTOR(2): Understanding of Work Requirement and Performance Work Plan: To
evaluate this sub-factor, the panel will subjectively assess the Offeror’s written plan for
feasibility and for understanding of the work requirement.
SUB-FACTOR(3): 3.
Quality Control Plan: To evaluate this sub-factor, the panel will
subjectively assess the Offeror’s written plan for feasibility, likeness to preven
discrepancies, and likely responsiveness to correct deficiencies as they are identified. The
evaluation will also consider whether documentation and information feedback proved to
he Government will be sufficient to assess the Contractor’s performance with respect to
inspections and evaluations conducted and remedial action(s) taken.
FACTOR (B), Past Performance: Performance risk will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15
by the Evaluation Team. In assessing past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several
approaches including (a) reviewing the experience listed in the proposal, (b) soliciting information
from an offeror’s customers and business associates; federal government agencies and local
Government agencies; and from other persons and organizations. The performance attributes
which the Government will assess will include, for example: the offeror’s record of conforming to
contract requirements, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s
reputation for good workmanship; the offeror’s record of forecasting and controlling costs; the
offeror’s record for adhering to contract schedules; the offeror’s reputation for reasonable and
cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror’s
reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers. The
attached past performance questionnaire will be sent to the Offeror’s past performance references.
This process will result in an overall risk rating of “Acceptable Risk” or “Unacceptable Risk”, as
defined below. The risk assessment represents the Government evaluation team’s judgment of the
probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror’s

Page 54 of 78

VA-786-06-RP-0050
demonstrated present and past performance. Offerors evaluated as “Unacceptable Risk” will fail.
Offerors without relevant past performance history will be evaluated “Neutral”.
Acceptable. Based on the offeror’s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror
will successfully perform the required effort.

Neutral. No performance record identifiable or not similar/relevant for the nature of the
work being proposed.
Unacceptable. Based on the offeror’s record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will
successfully perform the required effort.
FACTOR (C), Price: An Offeror’s proposal shall represent the offeror’s best efforts to the
solicitation. The total evaluated price will be the sum of all CLINs listed on the SF 1449
continuation pages of the solicitation (cumulative prices for basic and option year CLINs). Price
will be evaluated by the Contracting Officer for “price reasonableness” using price analysis
echniques in FAR Subpart 15.

providing similar services as specified in this solicitation within the past three (3) years. List three (3)

offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract withou

(End of Provision)

“HELPFUL HINTS” provided by the Government-wide Seven Steps Team:
1. This PWS provides a lot of detail, perhaps more than necessary. Consider removing
some of the requirements statements that are likely to be part of offerors’ solutions.
2. Sec. 6 of PWS says offerors should be innovative, but the decision will be lowest-price,
echnically acceptable offer (LPTA). If the Government wants an innovative solution, a
best value source selection would be more effective.
3. One part says this is ID-IQ. We suggest identifying which elements of the work or
which line item numbers are ID-IQ.
4. Attachment C talks about compliance, not about results. During market research, ask
vendors how they define success.
5. There are too many performance standards, things to measure and manage/report on.
Consider focusing on 5-10 key performance indicators (discuss during market research
sessions).
6. QASP is good but again, there is a lot of detail. Once those key performance
indicators have been identified, build the QASP around them.
