Dear [Name]:
This is in follow up to our telephone conversation of [insert date]. Thank you for agreeing to
participate in an important initiative to assist the [agency] in performing market research related
o the [general description of requirement]. Your company has been asked to participate because
of your reputation and past performance record as one of the leaders and top performers in the
Federal marketplace in providing [describe product or service]. I would like to personally thank
you for agreeing to take part in this effort.
A central tenet of acquisition reform is to significantly improve the quality of market research.
One of the main benefits of solid market research is to materially improve the Government’s
understanding of the current state of the marketplace, including commercial/Government bes
practices, industry capabilities, innovative delivery approaches, commercial market service
levels, performance strategies and measures. For this upcoming requirement, a special emphasis
of the market research is being placed on performance metrics and measurements, innovative
delivery methods for the required services, and incentive programs that your firm may have found
particularly effective. We are also interested in identifying performance criteria tha
differentiates between and among high quality firms in this field. We believe this information
will dramatically improve the quality of the forthcoming acquisition, inclusive of the solicitation
and resulting contract.
A joint meeting, with representatives from [agency], Acquisition Solutions, and your company
has been scheduled at [where and when]. Given the operations focus of the market research
being conducted, we request that your team be comprised primarily of program management and
operations personnel. Of course, business development and sales personnel are welcome at your
discretion. However, we do request that the majority of the team attending have operational
expertise. We encourage you to bring any samples or examples of best practices and performance
metrics and measurements that you feel would be pertinent to the project. To assist you in
preparing for this market research session, I am attaching an overview of the upcoming
requirement.
I do want to emphasize that these market research sessions are not competitions. The information
obtained from the sessions will be used to improve the Government’s knowledge of private
industry’s capabilities. No evaluation of participating contractors will occur and your
participation in the sessions is not a promise of future business with [agency]. No contract will be
awarded from these meetings. It is our intent that formal competitive packages will be developed
using information gathered from these market research sessions. The Government will evaluate
proposals and award any contractual documents in accordance with Federal Acquisition
Regulation processes and procedures.
Again, I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to a meaningful and very productive
session. If you have any questions regarding the meeting, please contact me at [insert].

Sincerely,
[Name]
