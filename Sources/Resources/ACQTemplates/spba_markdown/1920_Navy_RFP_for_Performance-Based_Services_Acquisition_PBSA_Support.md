## CONTRACT STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.0 PURPOSE
The purpose of this contract is to assist the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command
(SPAWAR), SPAWAR’s Echelon III Activities, PEO-C4I & Space, PEO-IT, PEO-LMW, PEOT
and NMCI in implementing Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) methodology on
large multiple award support services contracts resulting from solicitations N00039-03-R0032/0033. The goal of this assistance is facilitate a consistent PBSA approach and contracting
process such that after the contract expires, users will be fully equipped to maintain this process
without contractor support.
2.0 SCOPE
Implementing PBSA for the above organizations may include the following activities:
- fostering customer and contractor understanding, acceptance, participation and
competence in PBSA processes. May include participating in the development and
refinement of such processes.
- receiving customer requirements, usually via the Acquisition Management Automation
System (AMAS), and crafting task order Performance Work Statements (PWS) or
Statements of Objectives (SOO).
- assisting with developing and implementing performance standards and quality
assurance plans (may be defined at the contract level rather than the task order level)
- assisting with developing other sections of the task order RFQs; i.e. deliverables, source
selection factors, linkage to contract incentive criteria, funding documents, etc.
- assisting with the task order cost/technical proposal evaluation process, which may
require uploading and downloading documents on SPAWAR’s electronic commerce site.
- collecting, analyzing and reporting on task order/contract performance metrics data.
This does not include contractor performance surveillance, but may involve non-voting
participation as ‘recorder’ on boards determining the award of contract incentives.
- providing CDRL data and responding to ad hoc or emergent data calls. May require
creating/maintaining an automated, searchable repository of both current and historical
ask order information.
- facilitating process improvement. May include producing non-proprietary electronic
emplates/tools, drafting instructions/guidebooks, attending partnering sessions,
providing training, change management, etc.
3.0 BACKGROUND
3.1 Historical Services Contracting Environmen
Description of Contracting Vehicles - In 1999, the Program Management Team Omnibus
(PMTO) was awarded to five prime contractors who engaged almost fifty subcontractors.
Support services provided under these contracts fall into five distinct scope areas; Program
Management, Engineering, Test & Evaluation, Installations and Logistics. The contracts are cos

plus award fee, level of effort, “C-type” contracts with effort specified on Technical Direction
Letters (TDLs) incorporated via contract modifications. The five contracts were awarded by
scope area, but are not multiple award contracts (MAC), hence, no competition for TDLs takes
place. The contracts do not use PBSA methodology. They will all expire late in GFY 2004.
Volume of Usage - In the past two fiscal years, the approximate dollar value and number of TDLs
issued under each of the five PMTO contracts was as follows:
Scope Area
Program Managemen
Engineering
Logistics
Test & Evaluation
Installations

FY02 $
$73M
$26M

FY03 TDLs

Size/Complexity of TDLs – Approximately 35% of TDLs acquire one man-year or less of effort,
approximately 50% of TDLs acquire one to five man-years of effort, approximately 10% of
TDLs acquire five to ten man-years of effort and approximately 5% of TDLs acquire greater than
en man-years of effort.
3.2 Projected Services Contracting Environmen
Description of Contracting Vehicles – Before the PMTO contracts expire, SPAWAR expects to
award follow-on contract vehicles under the title of Major Services Acquisition (MSA). Two
separate multiple award IDIQ vehicles are envisioned. The first will cover the Program
Management scope area and have several prime awardees, hereafter referred to as the PM MAC.
The second is to cover the other four scope areas mentioned above and have several small
business awardees, hereafter referred to as the SB MAC. All contracts under both vehicles will
have CPFF and FFP line items and utilize the award term incentive. Since the vehicles will be
multiple award IDIQs, fair opportunity to compete for task orders, or exemptions thereto, will be
exercised per the FAR 16.505. To the maximum extent practicable, PBSA methodology will be
employed.
Projected Usage and Timing – It is anticipated that both vehicles will be awarded for a maximum
performance period of four years. Task Orders (TO) rather than TDLs will be issued. The
estimated dollar value and number of TOs per year under each vehicle is as follows:
Vehicle
## PM MAC
## SB MAC

Dollar Value
$80M
$40M

TOs
100
100

Historically, TDL awards were distributed over the course of the fiscal year (October 1 –
September 30) with 65% in 1st Qtr., 20% in 2nd Qtr., 5% in 3rd Qtr., and 10% in 4th Qtr.
[Note: PWS/SOO drafting, TO competition and evaluation take place in the mo nth or two before
award.] TOs may contain options.

3.0 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
As a result of contract performance, the government expects to achieve the following outcomes:
a. to increase the proportion of total services contracting dollars utilizing PBSA
principles by achieving greater than 50% of all services contracting dollars obligated under the
PM/SB MSA MACs utilizing performance-based principles.
b. to establish a process for the award and administration of TOs under those contracts
hat incorporates PBSA principles, minimizes processing time and maximizes ease of use.
c. to increase customer and contractor understanding, acceptance, participation and
competence in PBSA principles such that upon completion of performance under this contrac
hose customers will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain and improve upon
he application of PBSA principles without contractor support.
5.0 CONSTRAINTS
5.1 Key PBSA References
The Contractor may use any PBSA references it believes are appropriate to successfully achieve
he performance objectives listed in paragraph 4.0 above. Should a disagreement arise between
he parties over PBSA definitions and processes to be implemented, it shall be resolved by giving
precedence, in the following order, to the references below:
- Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.6, Performance Based Contracting
- Seven Steps to PBSA:
http://www.arnet.gov/Library/OFPP/BestPractices/pbsc/index.html
- DoD Guidebook to PBSA, dated December 2000
5.2 Electronic Systems, Software
In order to successfully perform under this contract, the contractor shall use at least two
government electronic systems; Acquisition Management Automation System (AMAS) and
SPAWAR’s electronic commerce system, e-commerce select. As described in Section H of this
solicitation, the government will provide two NMCI workstations in the SPAWAR facility to
enable this access. User training literature for these systems will be made available to the
contractor after award. The PBSA process developed and used shall incorporate the use of these
wo systems, or their successors.
For normal office use, the government utilizes the Microsoft Office Suite. The contractor
shall utilize software, and provide data deliverables, compatible with government applications.
When assisting with the task order proposal evaluation process, the contractor may need to use
an automated tool requiring DoD PKI certification. Obtaining this certification is a contractor
responsibility.
