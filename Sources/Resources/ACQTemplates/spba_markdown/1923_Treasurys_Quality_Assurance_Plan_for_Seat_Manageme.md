managed the contract effectively and efficiently, with successful and timely response to help

confirm whether the Contractor has satisfactorily met all reporting requirements, including
subcontracting reports when applicable.

he call logs and customer feedback will be discussed with the Contractor as soon as practicable.
Results of these meetings shall be documented by the COTR, along with the COTR's other
findings.

personnel to maintain system availability, resolve problems, and keep operations running as
