2. Task Order Title: Assessment of a New Emerging Technology Wireless Multi-function
Communications System
3. Background: A new wideband wireless multi-function networking communications technology
currently in development is nearing commercial deployment. The equipment is intended for
worldwide deployment and will have the capability to operate anywhere between 500 MHz and 10
GHz with an operating bandwidth of at least 25 MHz. The Department of Defense (DoD) needs to
understand the implications of this new system and how it can be utilized. The task is to describe
an “approach” to evaluate and quantify, using available modeling & simulation tools, the spectrum
related threats or benefits to DoD operations and provide a strategy to exploit or defend agains
he proposed technology to assure continued DoD spectrum access and further DoD objectives in
support of network-centric operations.

In support of the DoD’s NCW transformation, the JSC is embarking on a program to transform our data
resources and analytical and other capabilities to Global Information Grid (GIG)-based services. To date this
nascent effort has focused on evaluating some existing technologies that may support the transformation to
GIG-based services, identifying an initial selection of prototype capabilities or services to be web-enabled,
and creating a prototype web portal.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award
## EVALUATION CRITERIA
## APPENDIX A
## EVALUATION CRITERIA
This Appendix contains the Evaluation Criteria stated in Section M of the solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated
against the Government’s requirements for Cost and Price and for the two non-cost factors (Past Performance and
Technical). Offerors must meet or exceed all solicitation requirements to be eligible for award. Paragraph numbers in
his Appendix follow the numbering of Section M of the solicitation.
M.1. Solicitation Provisions.
a. Single or Multiple Awards. The Government plans to award a single IDIQ contract but may elect to
award IDIQ contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under the solicitation.
b. Evaluation of Options. Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR section 17.206(b) not to be
in the Government’s best interests, the Government evaluates offers for award purposes by adding the total price for
all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options does not obligate the Government to
exercise the option(s).
M.2. Evaluation of Offers.
a. The Government intends to conduct the source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiated
source selection procedures contained in FAR Part 15. The Government anticipates awarding a contract based on
initial proposals and does not plan to conduct discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to conduc
discussions should they become necessary.
b. The Government will evaluate initial proposals in accordance with Section M.XX, below. Based on the
ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the Government will identify the most highly rated proposal(s).
c. All elements, subfactors, and factors are measured against standards developed to represent guidelines
for adequacy of approach and understanding the solicitation requirements.
d. Evaluation includes the determination of strengths, weaknesses, and risks for each element, subfactor,
and factor.
e. In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of
heir proposal or to resolve minor or clerical errors; however, final proposal revisions will not be permitted.

HC1047-05-R-4009
Page 60 of 66
M.3. Basis for Award.
a. There will be one award category: Full and open competition.
b. The Government anticipates a single award resulting from this solicitation. The Government reserves the
right to award either one, multiple, or no contracts at all, depending on the quality of the proposals received.
c. In accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition, the
Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal
represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors, subfactors, and elements specified in the
solicitation. The Government will evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion with offerors (excep
for clarifications as described in FAR Subpart 15.3). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the
offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduc
discussions if the contracting officer later determines them to be necessary.
d. The contract award decisions for the full and open category contract will be based on the Government’s
evaluation of each offeror’s complete proposal against the evaluation criteria identified in Section M.XX, below.
Awards will be made to the offeror whose proposal contains the combination of factors offering the best overall
value to the Government. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s
estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement (FAR section 2.101). In making this
evaluation, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and management skills than with
making an award to the offeror with the lowest proposed price.
e. When conducting the evaluation, the Government will consider data included by offerors in their
proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.
M.4. Evaluation Criteria.
M.4.1. Factors, Subfactors, and Elements.
a. General. The Government will apply the following tailored evaluation criteria to identify the best value
proposal. The evaluation criteria represent key areas of importance to be considered in the source selection decision.
The elements, subfactors, and factors have been chosen to support a meaningful discrimination between and among
competing proposals. The proposals will be evaluated against the Government’s requirements using three factors:
Past Performance.
Technical.
Cost and Price.
b. Definitions. In order to provide insight into the Government’s value of the factors, the following
erminology is used:
More Important. The criterion is greater in value than another criterion.
Comparatively Equal. The criterion is nearly the same in value as another criterion; any difference
is very slight and unimportant.
c. Relative Importance. Past Performance is comparatively equal to Technical. Each of the non-cost factors
is divided into subfactors. Past Performance is divided into four subfactors, which are further divided into elements;
Technical is divided into four subfactors, which are further divided into elements. Subfactors are comparatively
equal within each factor. All elements within a subfactor are comparatively equal. Each non-cost factor individually
is more important than Cost and Price. When combined, Past Performance and Technical are significantly more
important than Cost and Price.

HC1047-05-R-4009
Page 61 of 66
d. Risk Assessment. The Government will perform a risk assessment of each offeror’s proposal. The
proposal risk assessment will focus on the risks and weaknesses associated with the offeror’s proposed approach.
Assessment of risk will be done at the Past Performance and Technical factor levels, and includes potential for
disruption of schedule, increased cost, degradation of performance, and the need for increased Governmen
oversight as well as the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. For any risk identified, the evaluation will
address the offeror’s proposal for mitigating those risks and why that approach is or is not feasible. Figure A-1
provides definitions to be used for Past Performance and Technical Approach.
(1) Risks may occur as a result of a particular technical approach, operational process, management plan,
ransition plan, quality assurance plan or as a result of the schedule and economic impacts associated with the
approaches or plans.
(2) A risk assessment rating will be used along with the color codes for each assessed factor. The
statements within the color code definitions assess different evaluation aspects rather than the risk assessmen
ratings. The statements within the color code definitions reflect how well the Past Performance and Technical mee
he solicitation requirements.

cost, or degradation of performance, and will require a low level of contractor emphasis and
Government monitoring to overcome difficulties

M.4.2. Detailed Description of Evaluation Criteria.
a. Non-Cost Factors.
(1) Factor 1 - Past Performance. The Government will assess the offeror’s capability to perform task orders under
he solicitation by evaluating the offeror’s past performance as a prime contractor on previous contracts similar in
size, scope and complexity to the JSC Electromagnetic Spectrum Engineering services contract. Only pas
performance data on efforts of this type, completed within the last three years, or work that is ongoing, will be
evaluated. The lack of relevant past performance information will result in the assignment of a white (neutral) rating
(i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable). Technically complex tasks managed and implemented across an enterprise
will be rated higher than tasks of lesser size, scope, and complexity.
Subfactor 1 - Previous Contracting Effort. The Government will evaluate the offeror’s past performance as the prime
contractor in management of large and complex efforts similar in size, scope and complexity to the JSC
Electromagnetic Spectrum Engineering services contract. The evaluation will focus on the offeror’s technical
understanding and technical capability as demonstrated by the results achieved in the completion of actual contracts
and task orders similar in size, scope, and complexity to the JSC requirement. Technically complex tasks managed and
implemented across an enterprise will rate higher than tasks of lesser size, scope, and complexity. The evaluation will
also focus on the innovative solutions developed and implemented by the offeror to address complex efforts and
echnical challenges, along with the results achieved. Emphasis will be placed on the application and use of
performance metrics and quality control plans that demonstrate program objectives and customer expectations were
met or exceeded.
Element 1 - Objectives. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to meet objectives and mission requirements on
Electromagnetic Spectrum Engineering services tasks similar to the size, scope, and complexity of the Task Areas
described in Section C of the solicitation.
Element 2 - Cost Control. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to forecast and control contract costs. Evaluate the cause of
any variances in the award amounts and the amounts at completion (or estimated to complete) to determine the exten
o which the offeror controlled project costs.
Element 3 - Schedule. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to adhere to an agreed schedule. Examine the cause of any
schedule variances to determine the extent to which the offeror delivered services on time.
Element 4 - Risk. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to recognize and manage risk.
Element 5 - Quality. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide a product or service that met the customer’s quality
requirements.

HC1047-05-R-4009
Page 63 of 66
Element 6 - Socioeconomic Goals. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to meet small business subcontracting goals, if
applicable. Consider any circumstances that negatively impacted the offeror’s ability to consistently meet or exceed
small business subcontracting goals.
Element 7 - Subcontracting Management. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to manage its subcontracting
responsibilities. Consider the offeror’s record relative to the timely award of subcontracts and payment of
subcontractors along with any significant subcontracting issues that resulted in contract cost, schedule, and
performance problems.
Element 8 - Business Relations. Evaluate the offeror’s ability to demonstrate a business-like concern for the
customer’s interests and the ability to demonstrate a reasonable and cooperative behavior. Examine the assessmen
o determine the degree to which the offeror met the levels of cooperation needed to be an effective business partner.
Subfactors 2-4 - Previous Contracting Efforts 2-4.
Elements 1-8 - Same as Subfactor 1.
(2) Factor 2 – Technical. Evaluate this factor on the basis of the proposed technical approach for performing the
contract, management of this approach, proposed approach to transition from the incumbent contractor, and the
strategic quality assurance plan, as described by the offeror’s proposal for each of the tasks described in the
solicitation. The evaluation encompasses an assessment of the suitability of the proposed technical solution in
relation to similar requirements anticipated in the contract; and the soundness, completeness, and adequacy of the
solution. Evaluate the offeror’s proposal to determine the extent to which the approach demonstrates an
understanding of the scope and complexity of the solicitation task areas. Subfactor 1 - Technical Approach is
considered comparatively equal to Subfactor 2 - Management Plan, which is considered comparatively equal to
Subfactor 3 – Transition Plan, which is comparatively equal to Subfactor 4 – Organizational Quality Assurance Plan.
Subfactor 1 - Technical Approach. In response to the solicitation, the Government will evaluate the offeror’s
proposed technical approach to meet the JSC’s mission requirements and performance objectives.

b. Cost and Price Factor.
(1) The offeror is required to submit all pricing data in the format indicated in Sections B and L of
he solicitation. Offerors are required to submit their proposed rates for the entire 60-month period, as set forth in
Section B of the solicitation. The evaluation period commences with the date of contract award and ends 60 months
later. Contract months and evaluation months are assumed to be the same. (If FAR permits a ten year contract, the
offeror will be required to submit proposal rates for the entire 120 month period.)
(2) Evaluate the proposed rates for the labor categories and other related costs for completeness
and reasonableness. Determine the reasonableness of the overall price on the basis of adequate price competition
and by comparison with the independent government cost estimate (IGCE).
(3) The Government may evaluate cost and price realism with regard to the ability of the offeror to
meet requirements in terms of skills required, complexity of disciplines and job difficulty, if the Government deems
such analysis necessary. Compare the offeror’s cost and price proposal to the technical proposals to determine the
offeror’s (1) understanding of work to be performed and (2) capability and capacity to provide the required services
and accomplish the required tasks. The Government may also assess the labor support information submitted
pursuant to Section L.XX, Volume III - Cost and Price proposal, as part of any cost realism analysis conducted.
Unrealistically low prices may indicate a lack of complete understanding of the requirements, a high-risk approach to
performance, and or an inability to attract and maintain a high-quality workforce. The Government considers the
findings of such analysis as an indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform and the risk of its approach.
