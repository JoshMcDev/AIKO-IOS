## AWARD TERM EVALUATION PLAN

1. Introduction
1.1. The purpose of this Award Term Plan is to describe the process by which
Contractor performance of this contract will be evaluated. The intent is to define
a process, consistent and effective, resulting in equitable appraisals of Contractor
performance and award term determinations.
1.2. Contractor performance will be evaluated by the Project Officer (PO). The PO
will perform the evaluation and make a recommendation to the Contracting
Officer that identifies if the Contractor is eligible for award term. All decisions
regarding award term eligibility including, but not limited to the methodology
used to determine Contractor eligibility, and the nature and success of the
Contractor’s performance are final and shall not be subject to the Disputes
Clause.
1.3. Evaluations will be conducted quarterly during the Base Year, Option I and
Option II, excluding the contract phase-in period. Award terms and the
evaluations are dependent upon the exercise of option years. The Contractor’s
performance during the award term evaluation period will be the basis for
awarding the Contractor additional award terms.
1.4. Any award term will be provided to the Contractor through unilateral contrac
modifications based upon eligibility as determined by the PO.
2. Award Term Evaluation Process
2.1. Award Term Eligibility. For each quarterly evaluation period, an overall rating
will be established, as defined below, to determine the Contractor’s eligibility for
award term. In order to be eligible to receive 12-month Award Term #1, the
Contractor must receive a rating of “Eligible” at least six of the first eigh
quarterly ratings, excluding the Phase-In Period. In order to be eligible to receive
12-month Award Term #2, the Contractor must receive a rating of “Eligible” a
least ten of the first twelve quarterly ratings, excluding the Phase-In Period. The
PO will rate the Contractor’s performance and assign the overall rating based on
a combination of two criteria:

•
•

The aggregate weighted average quarterly score for critical, urgent and
emergency service items (see Performance Work Summary Attachment);
The net dollar amount of service performance bonuses and deductions for the
quarter (see Performance Work Summary Attachment).

2.2. Rating
Eligible

Definition
The aggregate weighted average quarterly score for critical, urgen
and emergency service items is >90%; AND
The net dollar amount of service performance bonuses - deductions
for the quarter > $0.

Ineligible

The aggregate weighted average quarterly score for critical, urgent
and emergency service items is <90%; AND/OR
The net dollar amount of service performance bonuses - deductions
for the quarter < $0.

2.3. The evaluation of the Contractor’s performance will be based on the information
provided and used for the quarterly evaluation (see Contractor and PO
responsibilities for providing/comparing quarterly workload estimates and
completion percentages in contract sections G.2 and G.3).
3. The Government and the Contractor may recommend changes to the Award-Term
Plan at any time during performance of the contract. Recommended changes from
he Contractor shall be in writing to the Contracting Officer. If the Contractor and the
Government agree to change the plan, the changes will be incorporated into the
contract through a bilateral modification. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached,
he original Award-Term Plan will remain in effect.
4. Ineligible Performance
4.1. If the Contractor has failed to earn an award term by the end of Option Year #1
of the contract, the Contracting Officer may declare that the award term incentive
of this contract is void for the remaining period of performance of this contract.
4.2. If, during performance of Award Term #1 the Contractor fails to earn “Eligible”
quarterly ratings during the first two quarterly reviews, the Contracting Officer
may declare that Award Term #2 of this contract, although earned, is void.
4.3. The voiding of the award term incentive shall not be considered either a
Termination for Convenience or Termination for Default, and shall not entitle the
Contractor to any equitable adjustment or any other compensation under these
clauses. Notwithstanding, the Government retains the right to terminate this

NRC-10-06-430

contract for convenience or default in accordance with the clauses set forth in
Section I.

5. Miscellaneous
Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Award Term Evaluation Plan, the
Contractor’s right to an Award Term remains contingent upon (a) a continuing need
for the services and (b) the availability of funds. The Government’s not ordering
award term services for lack of either (a) or (b) above does not constitute a
ermination or a basis for invocation of the Disputes clause.
