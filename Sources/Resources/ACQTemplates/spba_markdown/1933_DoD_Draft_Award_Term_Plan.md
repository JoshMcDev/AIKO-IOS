INTRODUCTION

The Contractor may earn contract term incentives as determined by the Award Term
Determination Official (ATDO). The adjustments to the contract period of performance will
result in a total contract period of not more than 30 years. The Government’s purpose in granting
such incentive is to encourage and reward contractor effort directed toward performance of this
contract including incorporation of further opportunities for improved operational effectiveness
and minimized Total Ownership Cost (TOC) into the implementation plan. By way of
overseeing the Contractor’s performance, the Government will continuously monitor the manner
in which the Contractor is proceeding to attain such objectives and to discharge such obligations.
It is recognized that the standards by which the Contractor’s performance is to be gauged are no
susceptible to precise definition; however, the categories, criteria and standards on which
particular emphasis will be placed are set forth below. The award term will be issued to the
contractor through bilateral contract modification.
2

ORGANIZATION

The award term organization consists of: the Award Term Determining Official (ATDO); the
Award Term Evaluation Board (ATEB) and the performance monitors. The ATEB will consis
of a chairperson, the contracting officer, a recorder, and no less than five other functional area
participants. The members of the award term organization are listed in Appendix 1.
3

RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1

AWARD TERM DETERMINING OFFICIAL

The Program Executive Officer (PEO) will serve as the ATDO. The ATDO approves the award
erm plan and any significant changes. The ATDO reviews the recommendations of the
evaluation board, considers all pertinent data, and unilaterally determines the earned award term
length for each evaluation period.
3.2

ATEB CO-CHAIRPERSONS

The Deputy Program Executive Officer (DPEO) and Director of Operations Capability
Directorate or Designated Representative will serve as ATEB co-chairpersons. They chair the
meetings of the ATEB, arrange for advisors as needed, brief the ATDO on the contractor’s
overall performance, recommend award term plan changes and award term lengths.
3.3

ATEB MEMBERS

ATEB members review performance monitor’s evaluation reports of the contractor’s
performance, consider all information from pertinent sources, prepare annual performance
review and award term evaluation reports, and recommend the length of earned award term to be
presented to the ATDO. The members may also recommend changes to this plan.

3

DTCG23-01-R-D00001
3.4

ATEB ADVISORS

Advisors will be used whenever the ATEB lacks the specialty expertise needed to make an
informed performance evaluation and award term recommendation. ATEB advisors provide
specialty expertise, consultation and recommendations to the ATEB as requested by the cochairpersons. Legal Counsel, at a minimum, will provide an advisor.
3.5

ATEB RECORDER

The ATEB recorder is responsible for coordinating the administrative actions required by the
performance monitors, the ATEB and the ATDO, including: 1) receipt, processing and
distribution of evaluation reports from all required sources; 2) scheduling and assisting with
internal evaluation milestones, such as briefings; and 3) accomplishing other actions required to
ensure the smooth operation of the award term process. The ATEB recorder is a non-voting
member.
3.6

CONTRACTING OFFICER

The Contracting Officer is the Government’s representative during the award term determination
process.
3.7

PERFORMANCE MONITORS

Performance monitors maintain written or web based records of the contractor’s performance in
heir assigned evaluation area(s) so that a fair and accurate evaluation is obtained. Monitors
prepare annual review and end of period evaluation reports as directed by the ATEB.
4

AWARD TERM PROCESS

4.1

EVALUATION PERIODS

Evaluation periods will start with contract award or the conclusion of the last award term
evaluation, whichever occurred most recently. Award term evaluation periods end 1 year prior
o the end of the current contract term. Annual performance reviews will be conducted
hroughout the evaluation period. Award term allocations by evaluation period are specified in
Appendix 2. Figure 1 depicts the system level reviews and evaluations required by this
attachment and attachment J-7, the Systems Integration and Management Statement of Work.
The figure assumes five-year award terms.
4.2

EVALUATION CRITERIA

The evaluation criteria and their relative weight may change during the life of the contract. For
example, during the early years of the contract, system integration and management and asse
design and construction orders may have a larger impact than operations and support orders. It is
expected that the proportion and impact of operations and support orders will grow as the
contract proceeds. If the Contracting Officer does not give specific notice in writing to the
contractor of any change to the evaluation criteria prior to the start of a new evaluation period,

4

DTCG23-01-R-D00001
hen the same criteria listed for the preceding period will be used. The award term criteria are
provided in Appendix 3.

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS

The ATEB recorder notifies each ATEB member and performance monitor 30 days prior to the
end of each annual performance review period. Performance monitors will submit their
evaluation reports to the recorder 30 days after notification. Considering operational
effectiveness, total ownership cost and customer satisfaction metrics and information, as
described in appendix 3, the ATEB will determine the annual performance review results.
Through the Contracting Officer, the ATEB will notify the contractor of strengths and
weaknesses for the past year.
4.4

END OF PERIOD EVALUATIONS

The ATEB recorder will notify each ATEB member and performance monitor 150 days prior to
he end of the award term evaluation period. The ATEB may begin evaluation of the evaluation
reports and other pertinent current project management documentation 120 days prior to the end
of the award term evaluation period.
The Contractor shall submit a self-assessment to the Contracting Officer no later than 90 days
prior to the end of the evaluation period. This written assessment of the Contractor’s
performance throughout the evaluation period should contain any information that may be
reasonably expected to assist the ATEB in evaluating this performance. The self-assessmen
shall not exceed 25 pages. Updated (less than 1 year old) versions of the contract documentation
for which the Contractor is responsible shall be attached to the self-assessment. At a minimum,
it shall include:
(1) Implementation Plan,
(2) Asset Performance Specifications,
(3) C4ISR Architecture,
(4) IDS ISP,
(5) Concept Of Operations,
(6) Statements of Work for the next five years, and
(7) TOC Estimate
The ATEB will consider the Contractor’s self-assessment and attached contract documentation
in addition to IDS cost, schedule and technical performance data, especially the annual
performance reviews, collected during the evaluation period. The Evaluation Board will
complete an initial evaluation within 30 days. If necessary the ATEB and Contracting Officer
will then hold discussions with the Contractor to resolve ambiguities, weaknesses and
deficiencies in the Contractor’s documentation. This should be completed within 30 days. A
hat time, the Board will advise the ATDO of its recommendation. The recommendation will
include the Board’s findings, rationale, and justifications for its findings. The Evaluation Board
findings shall be furnished to the Contractor. In the event that the Contractor does not concur
with the Board’s findings, it may present to the ATDO an exception to the Board’s findings. The
6

DTCG23-01-R-D00001
Contractor will be given 10 days to provide a written response that shall not exceed 10 pages.
This response shall clearly identify specific areas where disagreement exists and the rationale for
he Contractor’s own rating of performance. These comments shall be considered by the ATDO
in establishing the award term.
Within 10 days of receipt of the Contractor’s comments on the Evaluation Board findings, the
ATDO will provide the award term determination (including the length, rationale, and
justification for the determination), subject to fair and reasonable prices, in writing to the
Contracting Officer. Any award term earned by the Contractor will be conferred to the
Contractor by the execution of a bilateral contract modification within 10 days after award term
determination and shall not be subject to any payment withholding percentage, notwithstanding
any other provision of this contract. A modification extending the term of the contract will no
be issued prior to definitization of prices for all orders proposed for the term. The governmen
and contractor shall agree on a fair and reasonable price for the award term period at least one
year before the time set for beginning of the earned award term.

AWARD TERM PLAN CHANGE PROCEDURE

All changes to the award term incentive evaluation factors and process for the current evaluation
period will be approved by the ATDO. Either the Contractor or the Government may initiate
changes. Contractor proposed changes will be negotiated. However, the Government retains the
final decision authority in making any changes to award term evaluation factors and criteria. If
he Government and the Contractor fail to reach agreement on the proposed change, resolution
will be reached in accordance with partnering agreement as set forth in paragraph H.4 of the
Contract. Such changes to the award term plan will be provided at least 30 days prior to the
beginning of each evaluation period for which the changes will be effective.
The weights assigned to each of the evaluation factors specified in Appendix 3, and the
procedures for award term evaluation may be modified unilaterally by the Government, provided
hat the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing prior to the beginning of each
evaluation period for which the changes will be effective. In the absence of such notification, the
evaluation factors and guidelines for award term evaluation remain as specified. The alterations
described above shall not change the total available award term incentive potential provided by
his clause nor change the award term earned by the Contractor in any completed evaluation
period.

APPENDIX 3; EVALUATION CATEGORIES
The Contractor’s overall performance during each evaluation period will be evaluated based on
its success in three categories: 1) operational effectiveness; 2) total ownership cost; and 3)
customer satisfaction. Category 1 is more important than category 2 and category 2 is more
important than category 3. Performance-based metrics will be used to support award term
evaluations. The approved Performance Measurement Plan will provide an entering position for
development of the award term performance metrics. Within 180 days of contract award the
Government and Contractor will establish a team to develop the final award term performance
metrics. The Government will have final approval authority.
5.1

OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

Evaluation of the Contractor’s performance in maximizing operational effectiveness will be
based on the ATEB’s subject matter expert analysis, comparing the actual results with the
proposed operational effectiveness and using that as the stating point to figure out if and why the
actual and proposed operational effectiveness are different. Allowing for factors beyond the
Contractor’s control and responsibility, the ATEB will evaluate whether the Contractor actually
achieved its proposed operational effectiveness objectives for the period. The ATEB will
consider:
(a) Proposed Operational Effectiveness
Proposed operational effectiveness improvements will be based upon a MarOpsSim (or
comparable, Government-approved Contractor model) analysis of the contractor’s
implementation plan and concept of operations at the beginning of the current evaluation period.
The most recently Government approved revision to the implementation plan and concept of
operations will be used for the analysis. Should the Government, for any reason, including to
account for factors outside the contractor's control, require subsequent changes to the
implementation plan or concept of operations, the analysis baseline will be updated to reflec
hose changes and the proposed operational effectiveness will be adjusted accordingly.
(b) Actual Operational Effectiveness
Actual operational effectiveness improvements will be based on Operational Test and Evaluation
results, actual metrics and data and operational subject matter experts’ assessments. Analytical
ools such as MarOpsSim may also be used to assess actual effectiveness, revising the assumed
inputs at start with actual demands and asset availability.

(c) Technology Infusion
Technology infusion will be based on the extent to which the IDS specifications and orders
revisions throughout the period to leverage new opportunities actually overcame difficulties
encountered with the start-of-period specifications and orders and demonstrably improved
operational effectiveness. This evaluation may include market surveys of similar IDS systems
10

DTCG23-01-R-D00001
engineering and asset design, construction and support by competitors of the Contractor. It may
also use the information developed for Technology Refreshment specified in the System
Integration and Management orders.
5.2

TOTAL OWNERSHIP COST

Evaluation of the Contractor’s performance in minimizing total ownership cost will be based on
he ATEB’s subject matter expert analysis. Allowing for factors beyond the Contractor’s control
and responsibility, the ATEB will evaluate whether the Contractor actually achieved its proposed
otal ownership cost objectives for the period. The ATEB will consider:
(a) Proposed Total Ownership Cos
Proposed total ownership cost (TOC) will be based upon the contractor’s IDS TOC estimate a
he beginning of the current evaluation period. The most recently Government approved revision
o the implementation plan and TOC estimate will be used for the evaluation. Should the
Government, for any reason, require subsequent changes to the implementation plan or concep
of operations, the analysis baseline will be updated to reflect those changes and the TOC
estimate will be adjusted accordingly.
(b) Actual Total Ownership Cos
Actual total ownership cost will be based on IDS order costs; other costs incurred directly by the
Government and chargeable to Deepwater appropriations; and savings and costs outside the IDS
incurred by Coast Guard assets or operations that are not funded by Deepwater appropriations
but are directly affected by IDS implementation. Validation and verification of life cycle cos
estimates with data collected during the evaluation period will be used to adjust out year costs for
he remainder of the IDS life cycle.
(c) Cost Control Measures
Cost Control Measures will be based on the extent to which IDS specifications and orders were
revised throughout the period to leverage new technology opportunities and demonstrably
minimized total ownership cost. This evaluation may include assessments of Systems Integratorfostered competition at the major subcontractor level; project management structure and
processes to control costs, market surveys of similar assets and major subsystems.
5.3

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Evaluation of the contractor’s performance in the customer satisfaction category will be based on
periodic survey results received during the evaluation period. Three groups will be surveyed:
users (including but not limited to; Operational crews, Maintenance activities, Area Operational
and Support Staffs), program/support managers, and project managers. Surveys will be
conducted at the start of the contract and at least annually thereafter and may be continuously
updated via web based technology. Each group will assess the contractor’s performance from its
perspective, measuring to what degree the contractor has met or exceeded customer expectations
in performance of contract requirements. Actual survey questions, format, and procedures will
be mutually developed by the Government and the Contractor, with the Government having the
11

DTCG23-01-R-D00001
final approval authority. Categories may include system availability, readiness, logistics support,
maintainability, and supportability. The Government will provide written copies of resulting
surveys to the Contractor following completion and analysis of the survey.
