Ground Rules
Ground rules deal with the behavioral norms team members can expec
from each other during team meetings. Establishing ground rules or
group norms is a powerful determinant of the informal group structure
and will greatly influence whether or not the team is successful.

Sample Ground Rules
1. Use X decision making method.
2. Share all relevant information.
3. Stay focused. Discuss a topic enough for everyone to be clear about it.
4. Don't take cheap shots.
5. It is all right to disagree openly with any member of the group.
6. Ask questions, when you don't understand.

Operating procedures refer to the team's procedural and logistical

he amount of time devoted at each meeting to deciding who is
responsible for certain items and tasks.

Sample Operating Procedures

agenda at end of session.
2. Meetings start on time. We'll start without you.
3. Consensus decisions will not be revisited unless there's additional
information on the subject.
4. For a quorum, there must be at least X members (total) present.
5. There must be a facilitator present at each meeting.
6. Length of the meeting will be determined by the agenda and agreed
o up front.
7. Substitutes will not be allowed for individual meetings.
8. Meetings will be held on a regularly scheduled basis.
9. The Team Leader is responsible for logistics, but all members are
responsible for assisting as necessary.
10. Minute­taker duties (capturing major decisions) will be rotated every
meeting. The Team Leader is exempt.
11. If you can't make a meeting, notify the Team Leader as soon as
possible.
