12

http://wmcare.samhsa.gov. 1 The Contractor is strongly urged to utilize
one of the laboratories listed on SAMHSA’s “Current List of Laboratories
Which Meet Minimum Standards To Engage in Urine Drug Testing for
Federal Agencies,” which is accessible via the Internet at:
www.health.org/labs/index.htm or at: http://wmcare.samhsa.gov; this lis
is updated on a monthly basis. If the Contractor chooses to use a
laboratory not shown on SAMHSA’s current list, the Contractor is
strongly advised to verify whether the laboratory’s methodology
conforms with SAMHSA’s guidelines prior to utilizing that laboratory to
perform drug screenings.
C. Other drug testing methods (hair, sweat patch, etc.) are commercially
available but are not acceptable for the purposes of this Contract, due to
widely varying standards of testing and laboratory reliability results.
However, if SAMHSA does issue guidelines on alternative drug
screening methods, the Contract will be modified to permit the use of
hose methods.
D. The presence of a positive reading for any of the above substances over
he designated cutoff level for that substance shall automatically
disqualify an applicant from working under this Contract. Since mos
drugs are metabolized within a short period of time (from several hours
o several days), the Contractor shall not permit any applicant to take
multiple tests in order to receive an acceptable reading.
E. The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with obtaining the
medical evaluation and drug screening for each Contract employee. All
costs must be factored into the offering prices.
Government Requested Screening.
A. The CO or COTR shall have the express right to request random urine
drug screenings at any time during Contract performance. Random
screenings shall be conducted by the COTR drawing a name from a
container that has the names of all guards on duty at the time of the
drawing. A representative of the Contractor shall be in attendance at the
drawing. Tests will be conducted at an appropriate facility of the
Government’s choosing. The Contractor shall pay the Contrac
employee the normal hourly rate/salary for all time off given to the
employee for taking the screening. Each screening shall follow the
guidelines described in section 7.02 above.
B. The CO or COTR shall have the express right to request targeted urine
drug screenings where there is a reasonable belief by the Governmen

illegal substances. Targeted screenings shall be conducted in a similar
1

The cutoff level for Opiate metabolites listed in the internet-ready guidelines is 300; however, that
number has been revised by SAMHSA and the new cutoff level is shown in paragraph A above.

13

fashion to random screenings, with the exception that the COTR will
advise the CO in writing that he/she requests a drug screening of a
specific guard. Once the written request is received, the CMO should
make arrangements for the test to be conducted as soon as possible
and within 3 working days. The Contractor shall pay the Contrac
employee the normal hourly rate/salary for all time off given to the
employee for taking the screening. Each screening shall follow the
guidelines described in section 7.02 above.
C. Contract employees who undergo either random or targeted urine drug
screenings may continue working under the Contract until the results
have been provided to the Contractor. In the event that the results of
any urine drug screening, whether random or targeted, are negative, the
Government shall bear the expense of the screening. (NOTE: this does
not apply to the pre-employment urine drug screening). The Contractor
shall invoice the Government for the actual cost of the drug screening
plus the hourly rate paid to the Contract employee(s) to take the test. In
he event that the results are positive, the Contractor shall immediately
remove the Contract employee(s) with a positive reading from the
Contract and immediately inform the COTR and CO of the result and the
employee’s removal from the Contract. Additionally, the Contractor shall
bear all the expenses relating to the test for the employee(s) with the
positive reading.
D. Any Contract employee who undergoes either a random or targeted
urine drug screening and tests positive for any of the substances
shown above shall be permanently disqualified from working under
his Contract. Since most drugs are metabolized within a shor
period of time, the affected Contract employee shall not be
authorized to take additional tests to achieve an acceptable
reading.
Psychological Screening/Reliability Testing
A. In those states where it is legal to do so, all uniformed Contrac
employees shall be psychologically/personality tested and/or evaluated
for reliability by the Contractor or the Contractor’s designated agent,
prior to employment under this Contract. This one-time pre-employmen
est/evaluation safeguards the employee, the public, the Contractor, and
he Government, for the benefit of all. The Contractor shall utilize either
professionally recognized written 1) psychological/personality factor
esting, such as the 16-PF or 5-PF (sixteen or five personality factor) or
2) ERI (employment reliability inventory) testing as an aid to selecting
reliable employees for this Contract. As a third alternative, the
Contractor may use state licensed (in the state where the Contrac
employee lives or works) psychologists or psychiatrists for in-person
interviews of applicants, to ensure that all such prospective employees
are psychologically reliable and suitable for all Contract-related duties.
While expressing no preference for any specific test, methodology, or
14

test provider(s), GSA has found reputable (professionally accepted)
computerized employee reliability evaluation tests that are priced below
$20 per employee when ordered in large quantities. Individual
professional verbal evaluations can be much more expensive, and are
not often used.
B. In those states where it is lawful to do so, each and all of the
Contractor’s employees and prospective employees shall participate in
and complete this pre-employment test/evaluation before they begin
performance under this Contract. The Contractor may request, in
writing, a one-time (per employee) waiver for up to 30 days to complete
he test/evaluation. The results and findings of the tests/evaluations
shall be documented, filed, and secured in the Contract employee’s
personnel file by the Contractor. The Government shall have the right to
inspect the test/evaluation upon request, as part of an overall file review.
The Government shall not have the right to use the results of the
est/evaluation to require the Contractor to remove/discipline the
Contractor’s employee.
C. The Contractor should consider the results of the test/evaluation as par
of the overall hiring decision. The Government does not intend, request,
or require that the results of the test/evaluation become the sole basis
for a hiring decision on the Contractor’s part, nor will the Governmen
request such information as part of the Contract employee suitability
clearance process.
D. In states where such pre-employment evaluations are prohibited by law,
he Contractor is not required to accomplish formal screening and
esting; however, the Contractor shall be required to provide the CO with
a written, signed, and dated statement on letterhead stationary from a
cognizant state/city Government official (or an officer of the court) tha
cites the specific law or statute that forbids such testing/evaluation. A
legible copy of the letter shall be placed in each affected Contrac
employee’s personnel file.
E. The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with providing the
ests/evaluations and for factoring those costs into the offering prices. If
he Contractor finds after award of the Contract that such
ests/evaluations are prohibited in all or part of the Contract locations,
he CO and Contractor shall negotiate a Contract price adjustment to
reflect the deletion of this Contractual requirement.
D. Security Requirements (Non-Classified Contract).
The Department of the Treasury/Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to
delegated authority from the Office Of Personnel Management, has
established mandated policy, also in accordance with investigative
requirements from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
15

(TIGTA), concerning investigative screenings for Internal Revenue
Employees and Contractors.

he necessary forms. If the Contracting Officer receives an unsuitable repor
on any employee after processing of these forms, or if the Contracting
Officer's Technical Representative finds a prospective employee to be
unsuitable or unfit for his assigned duties, the Contractor shall be advised
immediately that such employee shall not continue to work or be assigned to
work under the contract. Employees cleared through this process while
employed by a Contractor who is subsequently replaced by successor
Contractor in the same building, the successor Contractor is not required to
submit another set of these forms if the contract employee has been cleared
within the past three years, unless specifically requested to do so by the
COTR. (Include the terminology concerning NBIC specifically screening for
ax information as stated in mod #0007, of D.O. # TIRNE-03-T-00062.)
The Government shall have and exercise full and complete control over
granting, denying, withholding or terminating clearances for employees. The
Government may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant temporary
clearance to employees of the Contractor. However, the granting of a
emporary clearance to any such employee shall not be considered as
assurance of full clearance that shall follow as a result or condition thereof.

preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such clearance by the
Government. All contract employees shall either be U.S. citizens or have
lawful permanent resident status.

As required by Exhibit 3, deductions shall be taken for vehicle downtime if a
replacement vehicle is not supplied during the downtime period!
## DEDUCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPERVISORY AND
PRODUCTIVE MAN-HOURS
The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative shall compare the man-hours
reported by the Contractor with the Record of Time and Arrival and Departure from
Building form, or other approved sign-in/sign-out form. These reports shall be the
basis for computing man-hour deductions. In the event of a discrepancy, the entries
on the “Record of Time and Arrival and Departure from Buildings” form, or other
approved sign-in/sign-out form, shall prevail. For example: If the weekly report of
he Contractor indicates that an employee worked 8 hours, and the Record of Time
and Arrival and Departure from Buildings shows that employee as having been in
he building 5 hours, the 5 hours shall prevail and a deduction shall be taken for the
3 hours not furnished.
30

EXHIBIT 6 CONTINUED
B. DEDUCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTIVE MAN-HOURS
In the event the Contractor, for any reason whatsoever, fails to provide the
manpower specified for productive labor, deductions shall be made at the rate
specified in the "Contract Rate". The "Contract Rate" shall be determined by
dividing the Annual Total by the total number of man-hours (both productive and
supervisory) required annually. Deductions shall be made at quarter hour
increments.
C. DEDUCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPERVISORY MAN-HOURS
In the event the Contractor, for any reason whatsoever, fails to provide the
manpower specified for supervision, deductions shall be made at the rate specified
in the "Contract Rate". The "Contract Rate" shall be determined by dividing the
Annual Total by the total number of man-hours (both productive and supervisory)
required annually. Deductions shall be made at quarter hour increments.
D. DEDUCTION INCREASES FOR MAN-HOURS DEDUCTIONS
Deductions shall increase when the annual Total increases, and shall also increase
from the base year by ten (10) percent for each subsequent Option Year of this
contract; that is, deductions shall increase by ten (10) percent based on the previous
year’s deduction rate.
## EXAMPLE
If the deduction rate for the Base Year is $33.23 per hour of downtime, then the
deduction rate for Option Year I would be increased by ten (10) percent for a total of
$36.55 per hour of downtime; an increase of $3.23 per hour. The ten (10) percen
increase would be calculated for each remaining Option Year under the contract.

## BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS
The standard forms that shall be utilized by the IRS National Background
Investigation Center (NBIC) are as follows:
1. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 86, 86(EG) and 86A –
Questionnaire for National Security Positions;
2. Department of the Treasury/IRS 13340 – Information Provided
Concerning the Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to
Consumer Reports pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Ac
(FCRA), and;
3. U.S. Department of Justice I-9 Employment Eligibility
Verification

HELPFUL HINTS FROM THE SEVEN STEPS TEAM:
IRS PWS for Guard Services and other requirements that may include detailed-oriented
specifications
There may be prescriptive language that appears to make a contract detail-oriented and no
performance-based; however, agencies may have minimum requirements that must be met, such
as firearm training in this Guard Services example. We also see this when agencies are trying to
leverage what has already been purchased that could be a component of the proposed solution.
For example, if an agency knows it must use Microsoft software because all the licenses have
already been purchased, then that would be something the agency would have to disclose when
outlining the requirements. As long as the contract file documents why minimum requirements
are contained in the contract and they are based on something that has a reasonable rationale or is
mandatory, the contract can still be considered performance based.
