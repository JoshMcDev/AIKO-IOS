QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
(QASP)
1.0

INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements listed in the
performance-based Performance Work Statement (PWS) entitled “Facilities Operations and
Maintenance Support Services for the Western Regional Research Center (WRRC)”. This
performance-based plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines the Albany Research Center
will use in evaluating the technical performance of the operations and maintenance (O&M)
service contractor.
1.1

PURPOSE

1.1.1.
The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to measure
performance and to identify the reports required and the resources to be employed. The QASP
provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards
identified in the PWS.
1.1.2
This QASP is designed to define roles and responsibilities, identify the performance
objectives, define the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor’s performance,
describe quality assurance reporting, and describe the analysis of quality assurance monitoring
results.
1.2

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH

1.2.1
The performance-based PWS structures the acquisition around “what” service is
required as opposed to “how” the contractor should perform the work. This QASP will define
he performance management approach taken by the WRRC to monitor, manage, and take
appropriate action on the contractor’s performance against expected outcomes or performance
objectives communicated in the PWS. Performance management rests upon developing a
capability to review and analyze information generated through performance metrics. The
ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of
performance management. The data generated in a performance management approach provides
information that indicates whether or not expected outcomes for required services are being
achieved adequately by the contractor.
1.2.2
Performance management also represents a significant shift from the more traditional
Quality Assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on
assessing whether or not outcomes are being achieved and migrates away from scrutiny on
compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. The only exceptions
o process reviews are those required by law (Federal, State, and local) and compelling business
situations such as safety and health. An outcome focus provides the contractor flexibility to

continuously improve and innovate over the course of the contract as long as the critical
outcomes expected are being achieved at the desired levels of performance.
1.3

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

1.3.1
The contractor’s Quality Control Plan (QCP) will set forth the staffing and procedures
for self inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other
performance requirements in the PWS. The contractor will develop and implement a
performance management system with processes to assess and report their performance to the
designated Government representative.
1.3.2
The Government representative will monitor performance and review performance
reports furnished by the contractor to determine how the contractor is performing agains
communicated performance objectives. The Government will make decisions based on
performance measurement metric data and notify the contractor of those decisions. The
contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure
performance is managed effectively.

2.0

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1.
The Contracting Officer (CO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contrac
administration and cost control; and resolving any differences between the observations
documented by the COR/COTR/ACO, and the contractor’s performance.
2.2
The CO will designate one full-time COR/COTR/ACO as the Government authority for
performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as Technical
Inspectors depends upon the complexity of the services measured as well as the contractor’s
performance.
2.3
The COR/COTR/ACO is responsible for monitoring, assessing, and communicating the
echnical performance of the contractor and assisting the contractor. The COR/COTR/ACO will
have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms (refer to Attachments 2 and 3) used
o document the inspection and evaluation of the contractor’s work performance. Governmen
surveillance may occur under the Inspection of Services clause for any service relating to the
contract.

3.0

IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED

The contractor shall provide operations and maintenance support in accordance with the PWS.
The performance standards are established in the paragraph of the PWS that covers the specific
category of work. The acceptable level of performance is set in the acceptable quality level
related to that paragraph.

METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE

4.1
In an effort to minimize the contract administration burden, simplified methods of
surveillance techniques shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance.
The primary methods of surveillance are random checks, observations, inspections, complaints
and review of those records and files that are required to be maintained and delivered under this
statement of work. The Government will use appointed representatives, as well as reports and
input from Center employees and visitors as sources of comments on the contractor’s
performance.
4.2
The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between
its employees and customers. The primary objective of professional communication between
employees and customers is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significan
external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured
hrough customer complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer
focused through initially addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or
problems.
NOTE: The customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the COR as opposed
o the contractor. The COR will accept the customer complaints and will investigate using the
Quality Assurance Monitoring Form – Customer Complaint Investigation identified in
Attachment 3.
4.3
The acceptable quality levels (AQL) located in Attachment 1, Performance Requirements
Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage
how the work is performed while providing negative incentives for performance shortfalls. For
certain critical activities such as those involving facility environment, security, chemical
biological, radiological, and toxin activities, and accident control, the desired performance level
is established at one hundred percent (100%). Other levels of performance are keyed to the
relative importance of the task to the overall mission performance at WRRC/

5.0

QUALITY ASSURANCE REPORTING

5.1
The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected
outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and measured by the required
performance metrics in Attachment 1.
5.2
The Government’s QA monitoring, accomplished by the COR, will be reported using the
monitoring forms in Attachments 2 and 3. The forms, when completed, will document the
COR’s understanding of the contractor’s performance under the contract to ensure that the PWS
requirements are being met.
5.2.1

The COR will retain a copy of all completed QA monitoring forms.

ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING RESULTS

6.1
The Government shall use the observation methods cited to determine whether the AQLs
have been met. The Government will evaluate the results which then may be translated into the
specific negative incentives that cause adjustments to the contractor’s monthly payments, should
performance not meet the AQL’s.
6.2
At the end of each month, the QAS will prepare a written report for the ACO
summarizing the overall results of the quality assurance monitoring of the contractor’s
performance. This written report which consists of the contractor’s submitted monthly repor
and the completed Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms (Attachment II) will become part of the
QA documentation.
6.3
The ACO may require the contractor’s project manager, or a designated alternate, to mee
with the ACO, QAS, and other Government personnel as deemed necessary to discuss
performance evaluation. The ACO will define a frequency of in-depth reviews with the
contractor, however if the need arises, the contractor will meet with the ACO as often as required
or per the contractor’s request. The agenda of the reviews may discuss:
•

Monthly performance measured by the metrics and trends

•

Issues and concerns of both parties

•

Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trends

•

Recommendations made by the QAS based on contractor information

•

Issues arising from independent reviews and inspections

6.4
In addition to QA monitoring, the QAS will use the information contained in the
contractor’s monthly report to assess the contractor’s level of performance for each objective
measured in this QASP (detailed in Attachment 1). The QAS must coordinate and communicate
with the contractor to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance. The
contractor will discuss with the ACO/QAS satisfaction ratings receiving a “less than acceptable”
rating. For such cases, the contractor should highlight its perspective on factors driving customer
satisfaction and present plans to adjust service levels accordingly to bring the satisfaction rating
up to an acceptable level.
6.5
The ACO/QAS and contractor should jointly formulate tactical and long–term courses of
action. Decisions regarding changes to metrics, thresholds, or service levels should be clearly
documented. Changes to service levels, procedures, and metrics will be incorporated as a
contract modification at the convenience of the PCO/ACO.

FAILURE TO PERFORM

7.1
The contractor may receive deductions or even termination based on failure to perform.
The following criteria apply for determining appropriate action:
1. Notifications. Consistent with FAR Part 49, the PCO/ACO shall notify the service
provider of failure to meet standards through QA monitoring forms, cure notices, or show
cause notices and shall inform the service provider manager or designated alternate of
such notices.
2. Deductions. The Government has the right to deduct a specified dollar for failure to
meet performance standards. The amount is identified in the Required Performance
Metrics (RPM) of Attachment I.
3. Termination. If the PCO determines that the contractor has failed to perform to the
extent that a termination for default is justified, the PCO shall issue a notice of
ermination, consistent with FAR Part 49.

HELPFUL HINT FROM SEVEN STEPS TEAM: Be careful not to include more things to measure and assess than
is manageable. E.g., on page 7, the Government will assess UPS maintenance via reviewing files. It may be easier
o monitor UPS performance by observation – either they worked or they didn’t work as needed.
