TITLE
## EVALUATION OF OPTIONS

DATE
JUL 1990

GENERAL

The term “offeror” is used to describe commercial offerors, the
Agency Tender, and reimbursable public tenders that may propose in
accordance with OMB Circular A-76. The term “contract” is used to
describe a commercial contract, or a letter of obligation, which may
be awarded in accordance with OMB Circular A-76. This Acquisition is
for a Firm Fixed Price requirement. The source selection method is
low-price/technically acceptable.
Technically acceptable is defined through the performance levels in
he PWS (section C, and Section J attachments). This requires meeting
all the requirements (services and service levels) and standards
within the workload variances. Technically acceptable is NOT meant to
imply “marginal,” “partial compliance,” or “what is acceptable on
other contracts.” United State Department of Agriculture, Agriculture
Research Service (USDA/ARS) has specific and unique research programs
and requirements. Technically acceptable in this case means a

05-3K06-04

VOLUME I

SECTION M

historical level of superior performance that effectively achieves
he USDA/ARS mission in an efficient manner. The designation of
echnically acceptable is applied to both technical and price factors.
Offerors are also notified that the award will comply with the rules
of OMB Circular A-76. This includes the conduct of a cost comparison
between the Agency Tender and the low-price/technically acceptable
commercial offer/reimbursable tender.

M.3. BUSINESS EVALUATION
To be considered compliant, the offeror shall offer all items listed
in Section B for the basic contract period and each separate option
period. A review of the financial information will assist in
determining financial capability.

M.4

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING PROPOSALS

The following price/technical factors will be used for determining
echnical acceptability and realistic price.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA
1) Past Performance
The evaluation will consider: (1) the quality of past performance,
and (2) efforts similar to BARC/USNA requirements, and (3) the
quantity of related work.
The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each
offeror to assess technical acceptance. Performance risks are those
associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the
acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of
past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended
o be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an
offeror's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the produc
of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all
available and relevant information. When assessing performance
risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the
offeror as it relates to all acquisitions, record of conforming to
work statements, adherence of delivery and cost schedule and
performance including the administrative aspects of performance,
2

05-3K06-04

VOLUME I

SECTION M

knowledge of industry practices and procedures, compliance with
animal care laws and regulations, including standards of good
workmanship; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative
behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the
offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.
The Government will consider the number or severity of an offeror's
problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the
offeror's overall work record, and the age and relevance of pas
performance information.

The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of past
performance information:
Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, little doub
exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required
effort. A significant majority of sources of information state tha
he offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., tha
hey would do business with the offeror again. The type and quantity
of work performed is directly related to the PWS requirements.
Neutral – When no past performance history exist, an offeror withou
a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on pas
performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated
favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
In accordance with the A-76 Circular, the ATO is not required to
include past performance information. The type of work performed is
he same as the requirements of the PWS.
Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, some doub
exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required
effort. Many sources of information make unfavorable reports abou
he offeror's performance and express concern about doing business
with the offeror again.

2) Management Approach/Staffing Plan

The evaluation shall assess the quality and competence of the
proposed staff, and whether they have the experience and the
qualifications necessary to accomplish the described work. This will
include evaluation of whether the proposed experience, and/or
education demonstrates a thorough understanding of the operating
principles, and safe provision of services as evidenced by the
3

05-3K06-04

VOLUME I

SECTION M

detailed staffing data that identify the supervisor to worker ratios,
skills, knowledge, abilities, education and experience required for
each technical process and the proposed quantity of hours by position
classification, by requirement.
The evaluation shall also assess the offeror’s ability to hire and
retain personnel qualifying for the Position Descriptions at the
rates proposed and the offeror’s historical experience in hiring,
managing, and replacement of personnel in each labor category and pay
range, and historical and anticipated turnover rates.

PRICE EVALUATION

Although prices will not be weighted or point scored, they are
important. Prices will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism.
Reasonableness/Price Realism: Competition will be used to determine
price reasonableness. The Government may perform a price realism
analysis to determine if the prices in an offerors proposal are (a)
6

05-3K06-04

VOLUME I

SECTION M

realistic for the work to be performed; (b) reflect a clear
understanding of the requirements; and (c) are consistent with the
various elements of the offeror’s technical proposal.
Any significant inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between
promised performance, and price, if unexplained, raises a fundamental
issue of the offeror’s understanding of the
nature and scope of the work required and financial
ability/responsibility to perform the contract. To determine the
lowest overall evaluated price, the Section B total price of routine
work for all performance periods will be added to the Section B total
price of additional work for all performance periods.

M.6

RISK ASSESSMENT

An overall assessment of risk will be made for all factors
combined, and price to perform the requirements of the
resultant contract. An assessment of risk will be made
as to the probability of meeting the requirement successfully,
utilizing the offeror’s technical and price approach.
Risk will be assessed in terms of High, Medium and Low.

The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the
Risk Assessment:
High – Likely to cause serious disruption of schedule, increase in
cost or degradation of quality even with special efforts during
contract administration.
Medium – Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase
in cost, or degradation of quality, however special effort during
contract administration may be able to overcome difficulties.
Low – Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase
in cost or degradation of quality. Normal contract administration
Will probably be able to overcome minor difficulties.

EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (FAR 52.217-5) (JUL 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to
be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate
offers for award purposes by adding the transition period, total
price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.
Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise
he option(s).
(End of clause)
M.8

SOURCE SELECTION

The evaluation will result in identification of technically
acceptable proposals. To be technically acceptable, an offeror mus
be evaluated as acceptable on all technical criteria. This reflects
he criticality of the requirements and maintains current required
service levels. Upon approval of the Source Selection Authority, the
low price offeror that is technically acceptable will be chosen for
he cost comparison with the Agency Tender submitted by USDA, in
accordance with OMB Circular A-76. The cost comparison provides the
decision to convert or retain the commercial activity.

SCOPE OF WORK

C.1.3.1
The BARC and USNA require support services for animal and plant research efforts
o provide general animal caretaking (i.e. breed, feed, water, move, clean, maintain habita
conditions, effect research procedures, maintain animal records), dairy operations (i.e. dairy
nutrition and sanitation, milk production and quality), feed center operations (i.e. produce,
procure, store, and formulate feed), and field crop and research plot services (i.e. prepare plots,
maintain and harvest crops, produce grains and forages for research animals) IAW research
project protocols, the ad hoc needs of researchers, and associated BARC programs. These
support services also require IPM for fields, crops, plots, and greenhouse structures, greenhouse
structures oversight to support research and proper plant growth, and gardening services to care
for trees, plants, and shrubs for the Plant Sciences Institute (PSI) Plant Germplasm Quarantine
Office (PGQO) and the USNA Floral and Nursery Plants Research Unit (FNPRU).
C.1.3.2
The BARC encompasses 6,541 acres of land and approximately 65 miles of
roadway with over 600 buildings including offices, laboratories, barns, livestock shelters, and
storage and utility buildings. The USNA has a 448.9 acre public garden in Washington, D.C.
supporting both the BARC and USNA in research programs related to floral and nursery crops.
C.1.3.3
Animal research services require the use of multiple animals in laboratory and
modified farm settings. The BARC animal research mission involves work with many domestic
farm and laboratory animals such as cattle, swine, sheep, goats, rabbits, rats, mice, turkeys,
chickens, cats, dogs, and other species as required by research protocol. The animal population
may vary from day to day. Many domestic farm animals at the BARC are housed outside in
ypical farm settings with caretaking similar to that in a private practice farm setting. The BARC
beef herd at the Animal Parasitology Unit (APU) area consists of approximately 60 Angus cows
hat calve within a two month window with an average total number of 150 head on site at any
given time. The beef herd at Building 223 averages 100 cows that calve within a two month
window with an average total number of 225 head on site at any given time and is maintained
year round. The BARC poultry is estimated at 1,500 turkeys and 1,400 chickens and includes
hatchery and grow-out facilities. Laboratory animals primarily consist of about 100 cats, 20
dogs, 100 rats, and 4,000 mice (some transgenic). The swine consists of roughly 100 hogs at the
APU area and 600 ho gs (a few transgenic) at 3 different locations. The APU also maintains an
estimated 100 sheep and 15 goats. Animal research services also entail operating a feed center
and a dairy. The BARC dairy herd consists of approximately 140 mature Holstein cows, 140
replacement heifers, and 20 additional dairy cattle of other breeds used as part of a transgenic
research program. The lactating cows are currently housed in a free stall facility, with all waste
processed by anaerobic digestion and all milk harvested and sold.
C.1.3.4
Plant research services require care for plants outdoors and in greenhouse structures
while serving scientific research at the BARC PSI PGQO, PSI West-BARC greenhouse
structures, the USNA FNPRU, and 70 acres at the Glenn Dale location. The term “greenhouse
structures” refers to any or all types of enclosed structure used for the cultivation or protection of
ender plants, such as greenhouses, screen houses, lath houses, poly hoop houses, and growth
chambers. The PGQO processes germpla sm of regulated genera as a condition for entry and to

defend against the introduction into the United States any pests and plant diseases that it may be
harboring. There are 10 or more acres of fruit trees in the PGQO orchard and approximately 90
PSI West-BARC greenhouse structures. The Controlled Environment Facility (CEF) contains
many of the BARC plant growth chambers. The citrus quarantine greenhouse in Range 2 is a
Level 2 greenhouse requiring special entry clearance. Several new greenhouses are planned for
construction within the next two years, one of which is designated as a quarantine greenhouse. A
new containment greenhouse, almost completed in Range 1, also requires clearance for access.
The USNA FNPRU conducts a broad-based program contrib uting to basic and developmental
research and the implementation of new technologies for floral and nursery industries, with
emphasis on developing new and superior floral and nursery plants. The FNPRU also supports
he National Plant Germplasm System. The FNPRU has approximately 170 square feet of soil
preparation and potting areas, approximately 17,000 square feet of greenhouse structures space,
and approximately 36 acres of field plots in support of shrub and tree research. Unlike typical
gardening services, supporting plant research includes specialized procedures which may entail
working with exotic plants, experimental grafting, and other special purpose handling of plants.
In addition to routine plant care, plant research services entails routine facilities and equipmen
upkeep with specialized knowledge required for greenhouse structures oversight. Plant research
services also require farming of research field plots, typically much smaller than ordinary
farmers’ fields and subject to more complex and precise management requirements, using special
farming machinery and/or modified research equipment. Precision farming activities in suppor
of research may be more complex than similar commercial activities, whereas farming activities
related to feed and forage production for the BARC livestock are more like typical farming.

INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements listed in the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) performance-based Performance Work
Statement (PWS) entitled “Support Services for Animal and Plant Research at the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, Maryland and the United States National
Arboretum (USNA) in Washington, District of Columbia”. This performance-based plan sets
forth the procedures and guidelines that the BARC and USNA will use in evaluating the
echnical performance of a service provider. For the purpose of this QASP, all references to
“service provider” refer to either a non-government contractor organization or the governmen
agency tender.
1.1

PURPOSE

1.1.1.
The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to measure
performance and to identify the reports required and the resources to be employed. The QASP
provides a means for evaluating whether the service provider is meeting the performance
standards set forth in the PWS. The results of the evaluation, reflected in the reports generated
by implementing the QASP, become the basis for determining the service provider’s revised
compensation.
1.1.2
This QASP is designed to define roles and responsibilities, identify the performance
objectives of required services to be performed, define the methodologies used to monitor or
evaluate the service provider’s performance, describe quality assurance reporting, and describe
he analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.
1.2

APPROACH

1.2.1
The performance-based PWS structures the acquisition around “what” services are
required as opposed to “how” the service provider should perform the work. This QASP will
define the approach taken by the BARC and USNA to monitor, manage, and take appropriate
action on the service provider performance against expected outcomes or performance objectives
and standards communicated in the PWS. Performance management rests upon developing a
capability to review and analyze information generated through performance metrics. The
ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of
performance management. The data generated in a performance management approach provides
information that indicates whether or not expected outcomes and standards for required services
are being achieved adequately by the service provider. Metrics used in performance
management focus on desired outcomes and not on interim process steps. The interim process
steps are delegated to the service provider, who will be responsible for managing the internal
processes and practices used to achieve contractual outcomes. An effective system with
processes that generate well-defined performance data is central to performance management.

QASP
Dated 04.06.04

1.2.2
Performance management also represents a significant shift from the more traditional
Quality Assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on
assessing whether or not outcomes are being achieved and migrates away from scrutiny on
compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. The only exceptions
o process reviews are those required by law (local, state, and federal) and compelling business
situations such as safety and health. An outcome focus provides flexibility for the service
provider to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the contract as long as the
critical outcomes expected are being achieved at the desired levels of performance. By focusing
scrutiny on the desired outcomes rather than processes, performance management unlocks the
service provider’s potential for innovation and continuous performance improvement.
1.3

STRATEGY

1.3.1
The government will communicate performance objectives and standards expected
from the service provider through the PWS. These performance objectives are summarized in
he Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) table of this QASP. For each performance
objective and standard communicated in the PWS, the government will identify corresponding
performance metrics that are required to be tracked and reported by the service provider. These
metrics will provide an indication of whether the service provider is achieving performance
objectives at the appropriate levels of performance standards.
1.3.2
The government will define each performance metric and the data requirements for
calculating the value of each metric over the appropriate time period. The service provider may
use additional performance metrics for managing their internal processes and operations to
supplement the government’s metrics.
1.3.3
The service provider’s Quality Control Plan (QCP) shall set forth the staffing and
procedures for self inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and
other performance requirements listed in the PRS. The service provider will develop and
implement a performance management system with processes to assess and report their
performance to the designated Government representative.
1.3.4
The Government representative will monitor performance and review performance
reports furnished by the service provider on a regular interval basis to determine how the service
provider is performing against communicated performance objectives and standards. The
government will make decisions based on performance management metric data and notify the
service provider of those decisions. The service provider shall be responsible for making
required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is effectively managed.

2.0

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1.
The relationship between the service provider and the government will be a partnership
committed to the mutual success of each party.

QASP
Dated 04.06.04

2.2
As a minimum, the Contracting Officer (CO) will designate the appropriate number of
Contracting Officer Representatives (COR) as the government authority for performance
management. The number of representatives serving as a COR will depend upon the complexity
of the services measured as well as the service provider’s actual performance.
2.3
The COR is responsible for developing insight into the specific service of plant and
animal research and assisting the service provider with understanding the performance
expectations as stated in the PWS. The COR is specifically responsible for monitoring,
assessing, and communicating the technical performance of the service provider. The COR will
have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms (refer to Attachments 2 and 3) used
o document the inspection and evaluation of the service provider’s performance. Governmen
surveillance may occur under the Inspection of Services clause for any service relating to the
contract.
2.4
The COR is required to ensure changes in work are not initiated before a written
authorization or a modification is issued by the CO. The CO will be responsible for monitoring
contract compliance, contract administration, and cost control; resolving any and all differences
between the observations documented by the COR and the service provider’s performance. The
CO may call upon the expertise of other Government individuals as required.

3.0.

IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED

METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE

4.1
According to the Inspection of Services clause, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
52.246-4, the Government may evaluate the performance of the service provider. Such
surveillance will be done according to standard inspection procedures or other contrac
provisions and any action taken by the CO, as a result of surveillance, will be IAW the terms of
his contract. The Government, through the COR, will monitor the service provider’s
performance on a continuous basis throughout the life of the contract to determine if they mee
contract standards. The COR will use the surveillance methods of random sampling, inspection

Management Metrics detailed in Attachment 1 of this QASP.
4.2
The performance management process depends upon free and open communication
between the government and the service provider. As such, the COR will coordina te with the
service provider to explore means to maintain or improve the overall service level within the
constraints of the contract and the level of funding.
4.3
The service provider is expected to establish and maintain professional communication
between its employees and customers. The primary objective of professional communication
between employees and customers is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the mos
significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be
measured through customer complaints. Performance management drives the service provider to
be customer focused through initially addressing valid customer complaints and investigating the
issues and/or problems. During the investigation, the service provider should document and
report the following to the COR: 1) the nature of the complaint, 2) the results of the
investigation, and 3) corrective actions taken on valid customer complaints. NOTE: The
customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the COR as opposed to the service
provider by using the established customer complaint collection process. The COR will accep
customer complaints and will investigate using the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form –
Customer Comp laint Investigation in Attachment 3. This form documents the nature of the
complaint, the results of the COR investigation, and the corrective action taken by the service
provider to resolve the complaint.
4.4
The service provider is provided with a list of metrics that track performance agains
standards identified in the PRS. The performance metrics and their definitions are provided in
Attachment 1 of this QASP. The Government will provide the service provider with any known
data sources for the metrics, but the service provider should expect to provide the source data for
many of the metrics. In the QCP, the service provider shall detail how data will be gathered to
calculate me trics. On the first day of the phase- in period, the service provider shall submit this
documentation for government approval. The request for approval of the metric documentation
shall clearly articulate how the service provider will populate the data required that comprise the
performance metrics as defined by the Government. The request for approval of the metric
should specifically address:
•

The processes used by the service provider to collect data

•

The sources that will be used to collect data

•

The tools that will be used to collect data – information systems or other

•

How the supplier proposes to validate the data collected

4.5
The metrics approval requests shall be submitted to the COR for review. After the
Government grants approval, the service provider shall begin populating the metrics and using
hem to monitor performance levels. The COR will review outcome expectations with the
service provider. During the contract period of performance, the BARC and USNA may modify
or change the metrics that the service provider is required to maintain as the mission and

priorities evolves. Such changes will be accomplished in consultation with the CO, COR, and
service provider.
4.6
It should be recognized that while the BARC and USNA may have existing systems tha
capture at least some of the data required by the metrics, there are many other measurements tha
are not being captured by the current systems. When possible, performance metrics should be
used in a real-time fashion by the service provider and should be accessible by the governmen
COR. The data collected by the service provider should support monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual performance report development. The service provider may need to augmen
existing systems and tools for capturing measurement data. Metric data shall be non-proprietary.
4.7
The service provider shall be required to report the overall service level via customer
satisfaction results to the government. The service provider may propose satisfaction
measurements with ratings that shall distinguish between the various levels of satisfaction as
follows: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, and poor/unsatisfactory. The service provider
shall discuss with the COR, any satisfaction ratings receiving a “poor/unsatisfactory” rating. For
such cases, the service provider should highlight its perspective on factors driving customer
satisfaction and present plans to adjust service levels accordingly to bring the satisfaction rating
up to an acceptable level.

5.0.

QUALITY ASSURANCE REPORTING

5.1
The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of
expected outcomes. Expectations of service levels are expressed in the PWS and measured by
he required performance metrics in Attachment 1. The service provider will implement a QCP
hat sets forth procedures and responsibilities for ensuring quality work performance. The
service provider will develop a performance management process to assess and report their
performance to the COR, which will be submitted in a monthly Performance Managemen
Report.
5.1.1
The Performance Management Report shall include all required performance metric
data (Attachment 1) with a description of performance trends. The COR and the service provider
will jointly define the manner in which the information should be presented. The service
provider may also suggest supporting metrics to be included in the Performance Managemen
Report; therefore, the report may not be limited to just the required performance metrics. The
COR and service provider will agree to the graphical design of the reports and frequency with
which the reports will be reviewed with the service provider. The COR will identify the types of
decisions the reports are intended to support.
5.1.2
The service provider shall also prepare a comprehensive report to close out each annual
period of performance. This report shall contain the same types of data as the monthly reports
presented to the COR, but shall reflect the annual values.
5.2
The government’s QA monitoring, accomplished by the COR, will be reported using
he monitoring forms in Attachments 2 and 3. The forms, when completed, will document the

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

5

BARC and USNA
Animal and Plant Research

QASP
Dated 04.06.04

COR’s understanding of the service provider’s performance under the contract to ensure that the
PWS requirements are being met.
5.2.1
In addition to QA monitoring, the COR will use the Performance Management Repor
o assess the service provider’s level of performance for each performance objective measured in
his QASP (detailed in Attachment 1). The COR must coordinate and communicate with the
service provider to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance.
5.2.2
The COR will retain a copy of all completed QA monitoring forms and forward copies
o the CO and service provider in a timely manner. The service provider is required to respond
in writing to the COR regarding the QA monitoring forms recording performance that “does no
meet standards” within 5 working days after receipt of the forms.

6.0.

ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING RESULTS

6.1
The CO will review each QA monitoring form prepared by the COR. When
appropriate, the CO may investigate the service provider through Quality Assurance Evaluation
(QAE) surveillance, which focuses on a functional task review (how the work was performed).
6.2
By the 10th of each month, the COR will compile the previous month's performance for
he CO.
The report consists of the summary, the service provider submitted monthly
Performance Management Report, and any completed Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms.
This report will become part of the overall QA documentation to assess performance.
6.3
The COR may require the service provider project manager, or a designated alternate,
o meet with the CO, COR, and other Government personnel as deemed necessary to discuss
performance evaluation. Decisions regarding any changes to standards or performance metrics
should be clearly documented. Any approved changes will be incorporated as a contrac
modification at the convenience of the CO. Final decisions on the results of the overall
evaluation report shall rest with the CO.

7.0.

FAILURE TO PERFORM

The service provider may receive deductions or even termination based on failure to perform.
The following criteria apply for determining appropriate action:
1. Notifications . Consistent with FAR Part 49, the CO sha ll notify the service provider of
failure to meet standards through QA monitoring forms, cure notices, or show cause notices
and shall inform the service provider manager or designated alternate of such notices.
2. Deductions . The Government has the right to withhold a percentage of payment for the
monthly cost of performing particular services based on failure to meet performance
standards. The percentage of such withholding is identified in the PRS table.

3. Termination. If the CO determines that the service provider has failed to perform to the
extent that a termination for default is justified, the CO shall issue a notice of termination,
consistent with FAR Part 49. Upon terminating a Most Efficient Organization (MEO)
letter of obligation, an agency shall change the inventory coding to reflect that the activity
is no longer performed by an MEO and shall perform either a streamlined or standard
competition.

## PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT METRICS
The following performance management metrics shall be gathered (as specified) by the service
provider and reported to the COR in the Performance Management Report. The service provider
is encouraged to leverage technology in the compilation of performance metrics. For all
documented customer complaints, the service provider shall ensure that a formal customer
complaint process is established and advertised. The COR and service provider must coordinate
and communicate to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance.

ANIMAL CARETAKING

1-A.1

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:

Implement animal care and health management programs to provide general animal care
hat produces healthy and productive animals, meets research needs, and is IAW
regulations (PWS C.2.2.1).
1-A.1.1 Procedure: The service provider performance will be measured by periodic
inspections as well as by the collection and compilation of documented customer complaints
each month. Customers will be instructed to forward complaints to the service provider with a
copy to the COR. The service provider shall also develop an overall animal caretaking customer
satisfaction survey that assesses the following wide-ranging areas of animal caretaking:
compliance with regulations, professionalism, work place appearance, responsiveness,
flexibility, customer focus, and technical expertise and knowledge. The surveys shall be
administered by the COR. Documented customer complaints received are the main source of
data used to calculate the metric. All documented complaints received shall be reported to the
COR to discuss the validity. The service provider shall not incur any errors that damage or
destroy research or cause mistreatment to animals. Any complaint received as a result of errors
hat compromise research shall be considered unsatisfactory with zero tolerance. All other
complaints dealing with general animal care, adherence to research project protocols, and
compliance with mandatory guidelines that do not compromise research will be considered valid
if the COR and service provider mutually agree that the formal complaint resulted directly from
he service provider’s negligence. The final decision rests with the COR. The service provider
shall track and report all valid documented customer complaints (not to exceed 2 per month) and
heir resolution as part of the monthly Performance Management Report. The COR may perform
periodic inspections also at any time to ensure 100 percent of animals are properly handled.
1-A.2

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:

Maintain animal housing and support areas and habitat conditions to minimize health
problems and meet animal care guidelines and research requirements (PWS C.2.2.3).
1-A.2.1 Procedure: The service provider will be measured by the number of deficiencies
noted in the semi-annual Animal Care Inspection Report pertaining directly to sanitation,

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

temperatures, ventilation, and nesting. The service provider shall develop an efficient process to
review the Animal Care Inspection Reports to search for deficiencies. The pertinent deficiencies
result from non-compliance issues that are identified during the animal care inspection and tha
are not the direct result of a deficiency in the physical animal facility or structure. This
information can be obtained from the final Animal Care Inspection Report that is distributed by
he BAACUC after completion of their semi-annual inspection and is the source of data used to
calculate this metric. An Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) Sample Semiannual
Facility Inspection Checklist for Animal Housing and Support Areas currently used to prepare
for
such
inspections
can
be
found
on
he
## OLAW
website
(URL:
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/sampledoc/chek2a.htm). The service provider’s performance
will be measured by the total number of pertinent deficiencies identified as a result of each semiannual inspection, which shall not exceed a combined total of 10 deficiencies per report. If more
han 10 deficiencies are cited, a 2% penalty will be deducted from the first monthly invoice
following the report.
1-A.3

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:

Develop and implement a sound reproductive program to sustain animal colonies (PWS
C.2.2.6).
1-A.3.1 Procedure: The service provider will be measured specifically by the effectiveness
of cattle and swine breeding and reproduction. For cattle, the service provider performance will
be measured by the reproductive efficiency to get cows bred back rapidly after calving with a
minimum number of breedings per cow. For swine, the service provider performance will
specifically be measured by the average litter wean weight at 28 days and by the number of live
piglets per litter. The service provider shall continue to use the established processes to assess
cattle breeding and reproductive efficiency and shall establish a formal process to track the
breeding and reproductive efficiency of swine. The procedures for measuring cattle include days
open and services per conception and the procedures for measuring swine include litter wean
weight and piglets per litter. This information can be obtained from current and accurate animal
records documenting the history of animal species and is the source of data used to calculate the
metric. For cattle, the service provider shall provide the government provided Dairy Herd
Improvement Association (DHIA) testing service with the specific breeding records necessary
for calculation of this metric:
1. Date (month, day, and year) of the most recent calving
2. Date of the previous calving for second and later lactation cows
3. Reproductive status (pregnant, open, and bred but too early to detect pregnancy)
4. Number of breedings for all cows, and
5. Dates of first breeding and most recent breeding if a cow has been bred more than
once.
1-A.3.1.1 Days Open:
The service provider will be measured by the herd average number
of days open (best indicator of current reproductive efficiency). The days to first breeding shall

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

10

BARC and USNA
Animal and Plant Research

QASP
Dated 04.06.04

be used to analyze reproductive performance based on the date the cow was bred first. The herd
average goal shall be the current standard of less than or equal to 133 days open. Days open
measures the overall reproductive performance for the previous 12 months and can be influenced
by factors such as length of voluntary waiting period, heat detection accuracy, semen quality and
breeding technique, nutrition, cow fertility, disease, or weather. To calculate the number of days
open for a herd, record and provide to DHIA for each cow, the number of days from calving to:
1. Conception for pregnant cow,
2. Last breeding for cows which are bred but not yet confirmed pregnant, or
3. Current date for open cows.
DHIA will calculate the average days open for the herd by adding together the days open for
each cow and divide by the total number of cows in the herd. The DHIA results will be the
information used to calculate and report the metric.
1-A.3.1.2 Services Per Conception: The service provider will be measured by the herd
average services per conception. The number of services per conception is directly related to the
conception rate in a herd and is a good measure of fertility in cows. Conception rate influences
days open because if a cow does not conceive, she will be open an additional estrous cycle (21
days). The herd average goal shall be the current standard of 2.3 services per conception.
Conception rate problems may be caused by heat detection accuracy, length of voluntary waiting
period, semen handling and quality, time of insemination, insemination techniques, reproductive
ract infection, nutritional status, fertility, or weather. The number of services per conception is
figured as follows:
1. Count the total number of breedings (this lactation) for each pregnant cow,
2. Add the number together,
3. Calculate the average services per conception by dividing the total number of
breedings by the number of pregnant cows.
1-A.3.1.3 Litter Wean Weight:
The service provider will be measured by the piglet litter
wean weight, the most important factor influencing post-weaning growth performance. In
general, pigs with a heavier wean weight tend to grow more rapidly immediately post-weaning
and are less prone to digestive upset and diarrhea. The service provider shall meet or exceed
standards for weight relative to age, which is currently greater than or equal to 7.0 kilograms a
28 days of age. The average litter weaning weight is calculated as follows:
1. Physically weigh each piglet in the litter at 28 days of age,
2. Add the weights together,
3. Calculate the average weaning weight by dividing the total weight by the number of
piglets in the litter.
1-A.3.1.4
Piglets Per Litter: The service provider will be measured by the number of
live piglets per litter. Litters shall be the current standard of 10 live piglets per litter within 24
## PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

11

QASP
Dated 04.06.04

hours after birth. The number of live piglets per litter will be determined by physically counting
he number of live piglets in a litter within 24 hours after birth and is the source of data used to
calculate and report the metric.

DAIRY OPERATIONS

1-B.1

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:

Maximize milk production and optimize milk value to maintain or exceed current levels of
milk production and to supply quality milk (PWS C.2.3.2).
1-B.1.1
Procedure: For milk production, the service provider will be measured on rolling
herd average. For milk quality, the service provider will be measured on Bacterial Count or
Plate Loop Count (PLC), Somatic Cell Count (SCC), Cryoscope, and antibiotic residues. The
service provider shall continue to use the established processes to assess milk production and
quality. The dairy currently uses the government provided DHIA testing service to assess milk
production and relies on the purchaser to assess milk quality. The service provider will be
measured by the pounds of milk per cow per year as determined by DHIA and by the quality of
he milk as determined by the purchaser. To calculate milk production, the service provider shall
furnish the applicable breeding records to DHIA, who uses a standard formula to figure a rolling
herd average for all cows adjusted to a 365-day period. The rolling herd average shall meet or
exceed 23,500 pounds of milk per cow per year. The standard rolling herd average is a
measurement of the total amount of milk produced by all cows in the previous 365 days divided
by the number of cow years in the herd. To determine milk quality, the service provider shall
allow the purchaser to take milk sub-samples for analysis each time the milk is picked up (every
other day). Milk sub-samples results will be provided each month. The quality of the milk
directly affects the monthly quality premium and shall meet or exceed the current standards of a
PLC greater than or equal to 15,000, a SCC greater than or equal to 268,000, a cryoscope
between 530 and 550, and no antibiotic residues. The DHIA and purchaser results will be the
information used to calculate and report this metric. The government shall retain control of all
milk receipts.
1-B.2

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:
Dairy sanitation program meets federal and state regulations (PWS C.2.3.3).

1-B.2.1
Procedure: The service provider will be measured by dairy sanitation compliance
with regulations. This data can be obtained from the score sheets provided immediately upon
state inspection completion. This will be the information used to calculate and report this metric.

Dated 04.06.04

1-C.1.1 Procedure: The service provider performance will be measured by randomly
sampling research and non-research diets to ensure that the diets meet nutrient requirements.
Research diets shall include all of the specified ingredients while meeting nutrient requirements
100% of the time. Non-research diets may deviate from the specified ingredients (i.e. formulated
on a least cost ration basis) so long as the diet meets nutrient requirements 100% of the time.
The COR will select a working day each month to obtain random samples of diets to send off for
a feed analysis, at no additional cost to the service provider. The COR will not inform the
service provider of the randomly selected day. The service provider shall provide the COR with
access to all formulation diet sheets detailing the nutrient requirements as well as the actual
mixed diets. The COR will take a random sample of mixed diets to send to a laboratory for a
feed analysis depending on researcher’s requirements. After receiving the laboratory results, the
COR will determine whether 100 percent of the sampled diets meet nutrient requirements by
using the following calculation:
1. Compare the feed analysis results to the service provider formulation diet sheets for
accuracy (no deviations from specified ingredients allowed for research diets) and
nutrient requirements,
2. Denote whether the feed mix is accurate (those mixed diets meeting the specific die
ingredients and nutrient requirements),
3. Total the number of accurate feed mixes (zero tolerance),
4. Calculate the percentage of accurate feed mixes by dividing the total number of feed
mixes denoted as accurate by the total number of randomly sampled diets.

FIELD CROP AND RESEARCH PLOT SERVICES

1-D.1

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:

Manage and farm fields to efficiently produce high quality grains and forages for animal feed
(PWS C.2.5.1).
1-D.1.1 Procedure: The service provider performance will be measured on the quality of
grains and forages produced for animal feed, specifically corn and grass silage. The service
provider shall continue to use the established process to assess grain and forage quality.
Presently, samples are taken, sent to a laboratory approved by the government provided dairy
management consultant and the results are presented to the consultant for recommendations. The
COR will select a working day each month to obtain random samples of corn and grass silage
each month to send off for a nutritional analysis, at no additional cost to the service provider.
The COR will not inform the service provider of the randomly selected day. The service
provider shall provide the COR with access to the corn and grass silage and assistance in
obtaining random samples. The service provider will be specifically measured on the NDF
digestibility, which measures the amount of fiber that disappears when exposed to ruminan
enzymes for 24 to 48 hours. The greater the disappearance, the greater is the digestibility of the

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

Dated 04.06.04

forage NDF. The samples shall be analyzed based on a 30-hour NDF digestibility test. The
service provider shall meet with the COR and the government provided dairy managemen
consultant each month to discuss the results of such tests as well as recommendations for
adjusting rations. The monthly results provided by the laboratory shall meet or exceed 60
percent of the corn and grass silage samples having NDF digestibility greater than or equal to 55
and 60 percent, respectively. This will be the information used to calculate and report this
metric.
1-D.2

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:

Manage and farm research plots to meet research requirements in a timely manner (PWS
C.2.5.1).
1-D.2.1 Procedure: The service provider performance will be measured by meeting
research requirements and the timeliness of responding to all farming requests. The service
provider shall establish a formal process to receive, handle, and log requests from researchers for
farming services. This information historically originates from a telephone call or a hand
written, facsimile, or email request. The service provider shall acknowledge the researcher’s
request and inform them of where they fit into the current schedule. This information
(acknowledgement and proposed schedule dates) as well as the date of the original request shall
be documented by the service provider. The service provider shall provide the COR with access
o the tracking system or records used to document the receipt of such requests, the date/time the
service provider responded, and the proposed scheduled date for service. The COR, using the
racking system or available records, will verify each month whether 100 percent of the requests
were scheduled within a 24-hour timeframe by confirming the documented dates/times with the
researchers that requested farming services during the month. The COR will also follow up with
he researchers to ensure the performed work adhered to the specific research protocols and
where performed within the prescribed time constraints (excluding situations that are beyond the
control of the service provider, such as weather delays) 100 percent of the time.

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT

1-E.1

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:
Comprehensive IPM program effectively controls unwanted pests in a safe and
environmentally responsible manner (PWS C.2.6.1).

1-E.1.2
Procedure: The service provider performance will be measured by collecting and
compiling documented customer complaints each month. The service provider shall also
develop a customer satisfaction survey that assesses IPM in the following areas: compliance with
regulations, storage and mixing area appearance, responsiveness, flexibility, customer focus, and
echnical expertise and knowledge. The surveys shall be administered by the COR.
Documented customer complaints received are the main source of data used to calculate the
metric. All documented complaints shall be provided to the COR to discuss the validity. A
complaint shall be considered valid if the COR and service provider mutually agree that the

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

Dated 04.06.04

formal complaint resulted from inadequate IPM. The final decision rests with the COR. The
service provider shall track and report all valid customer complaints and their resolution as par
of the monthly Performance Management Report. The COR may also at any time perform
periodic inspections to ensure that unwanted pests are being controlled in an environmentally
safe manner 100 percent of the time.
1-E.2

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE AND PWS R EFERENCE:
Maintain and retain complete IPM records (PWS C.2.6.2).

1-E.2.1
Procedure: The service provider shall establish a process to ensure records are
correctly completed and continuously available as well as to ensure correctly posted areas each
month. The service provider shall provide the COR with access to all existing spraying and
scouting records that are maintained. The COR will review the spraying and scouting records
each month and will conduct periodic inspections of the areas that were documented as applied
o verify that 100 percent of the areas were correctly posted. The number of inspections may be
increased or decreased, as determined by the COR, based on inspection results. The percentage
of completed records that are maintained and available is calculated by dividing the total number
of records deemed complete and available by the total number of records inspected. The
percentage of correctly posted areas is calculated by dividing the total number of areas correctly
posted by the total number of applied areas inspected.

## SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION
SEE FAR 3.104

The following questions are of two types: YES/NO and RATING. The YES/NO
questions should be supplemented with explanatory narrative if answered “YES”
(one “NO” requiring explanation). When responding to the RATING-type
questions, choose the corresponding letter which most accurately describes the
contractor’s performance or situation. If the question is not applicable, circle
“N/A”. Responses to the RATIUNG-type questions should be supplemented with
explanatory narrative as well, if necessary.
OUTSTANDING: Contractor’s performance of virtually all contract tasks is
consistently noteworthy and provide numerous significant, tangible or intangible,
benefits to the Government. The few areas for improvement are all minor. There
are no recurring problems. Contractor’s management initiates effective corrective
action whenever needed.
GOOD: Contractor’s performance of most contract tasks is consistently above
standard and provides significant tangible and intangible benefits to the
Government (e.g., improved quality, responsiveness, increased timeliness, or
generally enhanced effectiveness of operations.) Although some areas may require
improvement; these areas are minor and are more than offset by better performance
in other areas. Few, if any, recurring problems have been noted, and contractor
akes satisfactory corrective action.
POOR: Contractor’s performance of most tasks is adequate with some tangible
benefits to the Government due to contractor’s effort or initiative. Although some
areas of good or better performance, these are more or less offset by lower-rated
performance in other areas.
UNACCEPTABLE: Contractor’s performance of most contract tasks is
inadequate and inconsistent. Quality, responsiveness, and timeliness in many areas
require attention and action. Corrective actions have not been taken or are
ineffective. Overall unacceptable performance shall not earn an award fee.
(Note: last sentence applies only to use with award fee).
