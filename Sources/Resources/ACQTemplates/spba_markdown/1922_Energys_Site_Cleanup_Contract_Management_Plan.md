CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE PROJECT HANFORD MANAGEMENT
CONTRACT (PHMC)
Purpose
The purpose of this Contract Management Plan (CMP) is to provide guidance to Richland
Operations Office (RL) employees involved with the management and administration of the
contract. Such guidance should be a useful tool to help the DOE ensure that FHI and RL
comply with all terms and conditions that govern the Contract. This CMP was developed with
he guiding principles that it:
(1)

Shall be a useful tool for administering the contract.

(2)

Shall be an executive summary of the roles and responsibilities of the contracting
parties.

(3)

Shall identify who is responsible for various contract administration activities.

(4)

Shall be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances.

This CMP does not include every action that the RL will need to complete to make the contract
successful. However, this CMP summarizes the higher-level requirements, deliverables, and
asks necessary, and describes the overall process within which the tasks are performed.
This CMP is intended solely to provide guidance to Government employees and should not be
construed to create any rights or obligations on the part of any person or entity, including the
Contractor and its employees. It is not intended to be either prescriptive or inclusive of all
actions necessary to support and/or administer the contract. It describes what the various
contract management processes are and how they fit together, but does not contain all of the
step-by-step details of those processes. For the most part, these details are contained in RL
Integrated Management System (RIMS) processes and procedures and specific desk
instructions and documents. Appropriate links to these details are included in the CMP.
Familiarization with this CMP and its related links is vital to all RL employees involved in
contract management, and each staff member involved in overseeing the PHMC is required to
read the PHMC Current Contract.

1.0

Background

The PHMC is a performance-based contract that emphasizes results/outcomes. The
Government’s objective is for the Contractor to complete the contract’s work scope in a timely
and effective manner that meets the terms of the contract. The Contractor is given the
responsibility of achieving end results and the freedom of determining generally how the results
are achieved. The contract is a performance-based cost-plus-award-fee contract. The PHMC
and its Performance Incentives (PIs) task the Contractor with performing cleanup work safely,
efficiently, and in a timely manner. The Contractor earns fee by accomplishing scheduled
cleanup tasks with available funding. All potential fee is at risk, and a sizable amount of
potential fee is tied to the successful completion of unfunded work. To earn fee for the

1

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0
July 2003
unfunded portion, the Contractor will need to perform the work with funds made available
hrough innovation and other cost savings. To earn any fee, the Contractor must successfully
perform the specific outcomes listed in the contract's Performance Incentives. The Performance
Incentives are multi-year requirements in which the Contractor is given freedom and
responsibility for technical, cost, and schedule baselines to accomplish the work and for
managing and maintaining them in accordance with their approved project control system. The
Contractor is also responsible for full and effective implementation of an Integrated Safety
Management System (ISMS) with full environment, safety, and health (ES&H) quality assurance
compliance.
The government is responsible for providing designated Government Furnished Items/Services
(GFI/S) to enable performance in accordance with contract PHMC Section C, Statement of
Work (SOW).
Earned fee may be reduced for failures to perform in accordance with these contract clauses:

Identification of Key Contract Management Team Members, Authorities and
Limitations

Successful management and administration of this contract requires the coordinated efforts of a
variety of RL personnel. Some of these key personnel include: the RL Manager and senior
staff; Contracting Officer (CO); Contracting Officer’s Representatives (CORs); Contrac
Specialists (CSs); and subject matter experts. This CMP delineates the roles and
responsibilities of these team members and describes their interaction on key contrac
administration duties.
RL Manager
The RL Manager is the Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) for RL. All procurement authority a
RL flows from DOE Headquarters through the HCA. The HCA is also a Contracting Officer
(CO). All actions that require CO authority are executed by the HCA or by COs appointed by
he HCA. As specified in the contract clause I.20, Conditional Payment of Fee, the RL
Manager has unilateral determination authority to reduce earned fees if the Contractor does no
meet minimum contract requirements for ES&H, Safeguards and Security, Level of
Performance, and Cost Control.
Contracting Officer
Contracts may be entered into and signed on behalf of the Government only by COs. The CO
has the responsibility and authority to administer the contract and make related determinations
and findings. Pursuant to Section G.7, Modification Authority, only the CO is authorized to
accept non-conforming work; waive any requirement of the contract; or modify any term or
condition of the contract. COs are identified, with their authorities and limitations, in the
CO/COR List.

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0
July 2003
Contracting Officer’s Representative
The COR has primary responsibility for providing technical direction to the Contractor and also
performs contract management, performance oversight and contract administration activities
with support of appropriate RL management and staff. Other CORs may be designated at the
discretion of the RL Manager to execute specific functional roles and responsibilities in suppor
of the contract. The designated COR(s) for the PHMC Contract can be found in the CO/COR
List.
The COR is responsible for providing technical and/or administrative direction to the Contractor,
in accordance with clause G.6, Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) Technical Direction Notification of Changes, and the COR’s Letter of Designation including the following:
•

Provide performance oversight to ensure the products and services for which the COR is
responsible are delivered by the Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of
he contract, including quality.

•

Perform inspection and acceptance of work, as required.

•

Conduct periodic reviews, audits, and surveillances of the Contractor to ensure compliance
with the contract, as required.

Key Contract Vulnerabilities or Performance Risk Areas Inherent in the Contract

The HPMP is the overall strategy for reducing risk to workers, the public, and the environment.
RL progress in achieving major goals are tracked in the Gold Chart. A Hanford site-wide risk
management plan is currently being updated. The plan will include risk areas inherent in the
PHMC. When the effort is complete, a link to the document and associated RIMS cross-cutting
procedures will be added to this CMP. It is expected that the final site-wide risk-managemen
plan will consider tangible and intangible risks such as:

Post-Contract Liabilities

Post-contract liabilities include site Pension and Retiree Medical expenses. The Contractor is
asked with prudently managing these benefits and it is DOE policy that, to the greatest exten
possible, no new employees are added to the pool of employees eligible for these post contrac
benefits. Since completion of all site work will extend beyond the performance period of the
PHMC, management of these programs will be transferred to successor Contractor(s).

7.0

Inspection and Acceptance Process

DOE is implementing a tailored performance evaluation approach that focuses on areas of
greatest significance and risk while relying on a planned approach to ensure that the balance of

7

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0
July 2003
he Contractor’s overall performance is addressed. RL’s tailored approach to evaluation is
based on:
•
•
•
•
•

an understanding of the performance-based nature of the contract,
knowledge of the Contractor’s baseline in response to the SOW,
awareness of the type and level of associated risks and hazards,
insight on the technical and management approaches to mitigating programmatic risks
and controlling hazards, and
familiarity with the Contractor’s approved management systems (particularly integrated
safety management and project management control).

Increased evaluation efforts are placed on those areas where there are indications of poor or
suspect Contractor performance indicated by Contractor self assessment or by Integrated
Project Team (IPT) surveillance and analysis. The level of review is reduced when there are
indications that the Contractor’s performance is strong and the Contractor’s self-assessmen
and corrective action programs are effective.
In general, DOE’s intent is to minimize the level of Government involvement and allow the
Contractor to perform to, or exceed, the contract requirements. DOE’s goal is to reduce
evaluations when the Contractor demonstrates an effective self-assessment program tha
includes self-identification, taking appropriate corrective actions, and successful follow-on action
o prevent recurrence and improve performance. If the Contractor’s performance is deficient,
and it appears that the Contractor’s management processes have not produced the desired
result(s), DOE can increase evaluations in order to protect the Government’s interests.

Key Performance Metrics

Contractor progress and earned fee are determined by Contractor success in meeting end
states specified in Appendix D Performance Incentives Performance Objectives, Measures,
Expectations and Incentives, as well as compliance with minimum contract requirements. All
work must be performed in accordance with applicable Law, Regulation, and/or DOE Directive.
Failures in contract performance as defined in the Conditional Payment of Fee may be the basis
in reduction of fee. The contract Inspection of Services clause is also the basis for Contractor
rework for performance that does not meet contract requirements.

Fee Administration and Invoice Review

Contract clauses concerning payments and fee include:
H.22 Payments and Advances,
H.33, Performance Objectives, Measures, Expectations, and Fee Distribution,
H.35, Provisional Payment of Fee for Comprehensive and Annual PBI's, and
I.20, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives -- Facility Management Contracts
Link to Contract Section H -- PHMC Section H
Link to Contract Section I -- PHMC Section I
The fee on the PHMC is administered primarily through multi-year Performance Based
Incentives (PBIs), where requirements are established in one fiscal year but the final completion
date extends into a future fiscal year. A PBI is an individual agreement that sets forth
performance objectives, measures, expectations and related fee distributions, and which is
incorporated into the contract at Section J, Appendix D Performance Objectives, Measures,
Expectations and Incentives. All of the Contractor’s available fee pool is allocated to PBIs. In
addition, the Contractor has the opportunity to earn Super Stretch fee for completing Super
Stretch Performance Based Incentives (SSPBIs). Final fee determinations for SSPBIs are
made, and fees are paid, upon completion of performance as defined in individual SSPBIs. Fee
for super stretch performance is outside of the available fee pool.
A Provisional Payment is a conditional payment of fee for partial completion of a multi-year PBI,
conditioned upon the successful completion of a subsequent event as set forth in the PBI. Upon
9

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0
July 2003
successful completion of the subsequent event, the provisional payment of fee will become a
final payment of fee. If the Contractor fails to successfully complete the subsequent event upon
which the provisional payment of fee is conditioned, the Contractor shall refund to the
Government the provisional payment(s) received associated with the missed performance
based event.
A Progress Payment will be a final payment of fee based upon final completion of an element of
a multi-year PBI, as defined in the individual PBI. In general, progress incentives will have
greater intrinsic value to the Government than provisional goals.
For any expectation to be considered performed, work must meet the criteria in the PBI and
must be accomplished within the approved cost and schedule thresholds specified in the PBI, if
any, as modified through the Change Control Process. The process for administering PBIs and
SSPBIs is outlined in Clause H.33, Performance Objectives, Measures, Expectations, and Fee
Distribution. At the conclusion of the appropriate performance period, the Government will
evaluate the Contractor's overall performance to determine the fee earned. This evaluation will
be a consideration of (1) incentive fee determinations by the RL Manager, (2) invoking Clause
B.7, Option Exercise, Reduction of Term, (3) in the DOE decision whether to terminate the
contract for default, and (4) whether to invoke the Conditional Payment of Fee Clause.
Under Clause I.20 “Conditional Payment of Fee”, the RL Manager may unilaterally reduce
earned fees for failure to meet minimum requirements of the ES&H safety managemen
systems or for failures in Safeguards and Security systems. This unilateral right also extends to
a catastrophic event, failures to comply with the SOW, or cost performance failures. Further RL
guidance is found in the RIMS procedure for Conditional Payment of Fee--Evaluation and
Reporting - Conditional Payment of Fee
The contract allows the Contractor to draw funds each month from a "checks-paid method of
payments cleared financing arrangement", a special bank account agreement, also known as
he letter of credit arrangement. This arrangement requires the contractor to submit an invoice
for costs that are withdrawn from the bank account each month. Data supporting monthly
invoices are gathered electronically in the HANDI system and are reviewed by RL technical
personnel. The procedures for invoice review and approval, including review of HANDI data
generated under this contract, are included in Procurement Division Procedure PRO-020 Rev.
1, Invoice Processing -- Invoice Processing

Unique Contract Terms and Conditions

The Government has a responsibility to enable contract performance by ensuring that GFI/S are
available, timely and of the required quality. GFI/S is described in the contract SOW. GFI/S
examples include providing approvals of Contractor submittals, approval of authorization basis
and regulatory decision documents and reports; and approval of management products and
controls deliverables. If GFI/S are not furnished as specified in the contract, the Contractor may
be due an equitable adjustment in target cost.
Required government responses and approvals
In the course of performing the contract, the Contractor is required to obtain the Government’s
review and/or approval of numerous documents and management systems. It is imperative tha

10

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0
July 2003
he Government provides appropriate responses within timeframes specified by the contract. I
is expected that DOE and the Contractor will use a collaborative process to ensure that key
documents, such as authorization basis and regulatory decision documents and reports, are
developed in a quality manner meeting applicable requirements and are timely and efficiently
reviewed and approved. It is also expected that reviews of key Contractor management system
documentation, such as the integrated safety management system description and Projec
Management Plan, will be conducted with the Contractor prior to formal submittal by the
Contractor for review and approval.
A new process for defining and managing GFI/S is being established in the RIMS. Specific
government responses and approvals supporting the PHMC contract deliverables and actions
will be identified in the RL GFI/S List, including schedule commitment and DOE responsibility
information. In the interim, a link to the FHI list of GFI/S is provided. GFI/S

Contractor Litigation Management

The Department of Energy established regulations covering contractor legal management
requirements. The RIMS crosscutting process was established to assist personnel in controlling
and overseeing litigation costs for which contractors seek reimbursement under the terms of
heir contracts, including general legal services. It also provides information for instances when
he Richland Operations Office retains legal counsel for litigation where legal costs over the life
of the matter are expected to exceed $100,000. This crosscutting process is maintained by the
Office of Chief Counsel and is at this site -- Litigation Management - Contractor.

Agreements

Mutual Aid Agreements
The Contractor and/or RL are parties to agreements and understandings with Federal, State,
and Local Government Agencies, corporations, universities, and hospitals. These Agreements
are listed in Contract Section J, Appendix C, section J.C.2.8 Mutual Aid Agreements.

Contract Records

All records acquired or generated by the contractor in performing this contract shall be the
property of the Government except for those defined as "contractor-owned" in contract clause
I.167 "Access to and Ownership of Records (DEAR clause 970.5204-3). These records shall be
delivered to the Government or otherwise disposed of at contract completion or termination, as
directed by the Contracting Officer. PHMC Section I Additional Contractor requirements
concerning records management are found in clauses H.20, "Information" and H.21, "Privacy
11

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0

Act Systems of Records". PHMC Section H The Contract Clause entitled "Access to and
Ownership of Records" addresses records management with respect to occupational health
records and radiation exposure records:
All occupational health records generated during the performance of Hanford-related activities
will be maintained by the Occupational/Medical Services Contractor and are the property of
DOE. All radiation exposure records generated during the performance of Hanford-related
activities will be maintained by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and are the
property of DOE. The RL strategy for identifying which records will be transferred or maintained
by DOE with the expiration of the PHMC is intended to ensure that the government is protected
and that a good records management program exists. RL procedures for records are in RIMS
under Records Management.

19.0

Post Contract Liabilities

Site cleanup activities extend beyond the contract period of performance. If all site cleanup
were to be accomplished under this contract, the contractor would be requested to identify postcontract liabilities with adequate documentation supported by a reasonable audit trail as to
measurement, composition, cost methods, and actuarial assumptions.

20.0

Contract Closeout

When the Contractor has completed the work scope, the process of verification of contract
completion and initiation of contract closeout can commence. Major elements of contrac

Contract Communication Process

Formal communications with the Contractor
All formal direction to the Contractor is issued by the RL Manager (as Contracting Officer), or as
delegated, the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) within
designated authority. Such direction should be in writing, but may be provided orally in
meetings, briefings, phone, or video conferencing. A written record of direction should be
created for such oral directions. All formal written correspondence to the Contractor should
include the contract number within the subject line. Correspondence will include the following
statement, where applicable--"The Government considers this action to be within the scope of
he existing contract and therefore, the action does not involve or authorize any delay in delivery
or additional cost to the Government, either direct or indirect."
The following caveat should be included within the body of correspondence issued by CORs:
“If in my capacity as a Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), I provide any
direction which your company believes exceeds my authority, you are to immediately
notify the Contracting Officer and request clarification prior to complying with the
direction.”
The Contracting Officer must be on concurrence for all correspondence to the Contractor (e.g.
echnical direction by the COR) and receive a copy when issued. Only the Contracting Officer
has the authority to interpret the contract terms and conditions or make changes to the contract.
A list of COs/CORs is identified in the CO/COR list found in RIMS.
To ensure correspondence control, all formal correspondence should be addressed to the
Contractor’s local principal executive and shall cite the contract number and applicable contrac
provision in the letter’s subjectline. .
Formal communication from the Contractor should follow a formal contract correspondence
racking system with commitments appropriately assigned and tracked for timely completion.
Informal communications with the Contractor
Informal communications can occur between an RL employee and any Contractor employee.
This type of communication is non-binding for both the Government and the Contractor and
does not constitute contract direction (i.e., formal communication). Informal communication can
ake the form of electronic mail, retrievable databases, telephone, facsimile, presentations,
meetings, and other means.
Informal communications between RL and Contractor staff are needed for proper oversigh
coordination. This communication should be constructive in nature. Avoid requesting
information obtainable by other means. In their informal communications, RL employees need
o avoid the impression the communications are formal. Particularly, when COs or CORs are
engaging in informal communications, they must be careful to identify those communications as
non-binding. CORs should inform the Contractor as to whether or not the communications or
portions thereof are formal or informal. More specific expectations for RL interfaces with
Contractors are described in the RIMS Contract Management and Contractor Oversight and
Evaluation Planning crosscutting processes.
Non-RL Communications

DE-AC06-96RL13200
CMP Rev. 1.0
July 2003
The Contractor will be required to communicate with other than RL staff in conjunction with its
responsibilities and work scope. The following parties most likely to be involved are: DOEHeadquarters; other Federal agencies and offices including the Environmental Protection
Agency and Government Accounting Office; the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board; other
Hanford Contractors; Hanford Advisory Board; State agencies and officials including the
Washington State Departments of Ecology & Health; Tribal Nations; and the general public.
Because these entities are outside of the contractual relationship between the Contractor and
RL, their communications to the Contractor may not be construed as contractual direction to
change the scope or terms and conditions of the contract. It is expected, however, that these
“stakeholder” communications are coordinated or monitored by the CO, COR, or responsible
IPT participant as described in RIMS Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Affairs crosscutting
processes.
