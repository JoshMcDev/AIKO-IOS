MEMORANDUM FOR GSA CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES
FROM:

JEFFREY A. KOSES
## SENIOR PROCUREMENT EXECUTIVE
OFFICE OF ACQUISITION POLICY (MV)

SUBJECT:

FAR and GSAM Class Deviation - Public Buildings Service
Limited Authority for Ten (10) Year Operations and
Maintenance Service Procurements When Using Schedules

1. Purpose​. This memorandum approves an updated class FAR and GSAM deviation
o provide Public Buildings Service (PBS) limited authority to establish Blanke
Purchase Agreements (BPAs) and task orders for operations and maintenance
requirements related to fixed equipment in GSA controlled buildings with contrac
erms up to ten (10) years.
2. Background​. On November 16, 2018, the Senior Procurement Executive approved
Class Deviation CD-2019-01 entitled “FAR and GSAM class deviation - Limited
Authority for Ten (10) Year Operations and Maintenance Service Procurements
When Using Schedule 03-FAC.” Since the approval of this class deviation the
Federal Acquisition Service consolidated the Federal Supply Schedules from
wenty-four (24) to one. This consolidation requires that the prior deviation be
updated. This update takes the form of a new deviation.
The MAS is now organized into large categories, subcategories, and Special Item
Numbers (SINs). One of the large categories within the MAS is the Facilities
Category. The Facilities Category encompasses most of the items previously offered
under the 03FAC, Facilities Maintenance and Management Schedule. The
remaining items, such as Order-Level Materials (SIN OLM), Ancillary Repair and
Alterations (SIN ANCRA), and Ancillary Supplies and Services (SIN ANCILLARY)
are now offered under MAS Miscellaneous Category in the Complementary SINs
subcategory.
Based on the change to the GSA FSS program, class deviation 2019-01 is being
updated in the form of a replacement deviation to ensure PBS continued use of this
limited authority.
