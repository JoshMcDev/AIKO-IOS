Introduction

The General Services Administration (GSA) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) have
partnered to sign the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to provide Future COMSATCOM Services
Acquisition (FCSA). Under FCSA Complex Commercial SATCOM Solutions (CS3) was awarded. CS3 is a
multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) firm fixed-price contract; all task orders
issued against this contract will be firm fixed-price. Under CS3, a task order is the official contractual
mechanism to be used by agencies to order COMSATCOM services and ancillary products or services. All
ask orders are subject to fair opportunity as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505: the
FAR requires all awardees under a multiple award contract be given a fair opportunity to be considered
for each task order in excess of $3,500, unless an exception applies.
The CS3 program offers customers a wide range of benefits:
●
●

quality, and increased system availability
Expanded role for small businesses to receive the maximum level of satellite systems business
consistent with quality performance and value for government buyers
Enhanced contract flexibility with a ten-year period of performance
Leveraged buying power as a single source for satellite services acquisition across the Federal
Governmen

Contract Objectives

The overarching objective for CS3 is to create contracts as flexible and agile as possible to meet and satisfy
he widely differing requirements of federal organizations at present, for the next decade, and for the
period beyond. CS3 is intended to meet program goals for the following:

Purpose and Scope

GSA’s Office of Enterprise Technology Solutions (ETS) developed this Customer Ordering Guide for
Ordering Contracting Officers (OCOs) and other stakeholders to facilitate the use of GSA’s CS3 vehicle to
successfully place new orders on the contract. It also serves to inform and acquaint all agencies with the
proper use of CS3.
This Guide provides guidelines and ordering processes for satellite services under CS3 service providers
(Contractors). It defines the roles and responsibilities of GSA and the ordering agency. More information
regarding the CS3 program, its contractors (Appendix C) and contract updates is available on the GSA CS3
website at GSA CS3. The guidance provided here does not supersede requirements of the FAR or agency
FAR supplements and policies.

2.1

Guide Layout

The remainder of this Guide provides general contract guidance then focuses on the ordering process. It
is divided into the following sections:
●

Contract General Guidance (Section 3)

Contract General Guidance

3.1

Term of Contract

CS3 contracts are not Federal Supply Schedules or Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs);
herefore, the guidelines and rules for using these contracts differ from those for Schedules and GWACs.
The contract period of performance (PoP) consists of one (1) five-year base period plus one (1) three-year
option period and one (1) two-year option period (Ordering Period of Performance). The government may
unilaterally exercise the option periods.
The CS3 PoP is as follows:
●
●
●

Base period:
Option period 1:
Option period 2:

10/16/2017 through 10/15/2022
10/16/2022 through 10/15/2025
10/16/2025 through 10/15/2027

Minimum Order Value: None
Maximum Order Value: The cumulative amount of all task orders combined—including all options—
cannot exceed the program ceiling amount of $2.5B.

3.2

Ordering Guidelines

As highlighted in section 1.2 Contract Scope, all stand-alone Satellite Professional Support Services must
be ordered from a small business.

September 2022, v1.5

CS3 Customer Ordering Guide
Redacted versions of the CS3 contracts, which include contract period pricing, are available for viewing
and download from each contractor’s website. Some contractors may require registration before allowing
access, and links to each contract are provided via the contractor’s link located in Appendix C and at GSA
CS3.
●

3.3

Order Type—Orders under the basic contract will be firm fixed price. Orders must be task orders
in compliance with FAR 16.505. Task orders may be multi-year and/or include options as defined
in FAR Part 17 and agency-specific FAR Part 17 supplements. The OCO must use performancebased acquisition methods to the maximum extent practicable
Order Pricing—The OCO is responsible for the determination of reasonable price for each order
placed under CS3. The OCO must determine fair and reasonable pricing for all orders in
accordance with FAR Subpart 15.4—Contract Pricing—and FAR 16.202—Firm-fixed-price
contracts
Travel—A task order may require travel which will be identified in the task order. All travel shall
be accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR)/Joint Travel Regulations (JTR)

Task Order Period of Performance

The term for each order placed under the Basic Contract shall be specified in the Individual Order. Under
no circumstances may an order be placed under the Basic Contract if the Basic Contract has expired, been
erminated, or canceled by the government. The base period expires October 15, 2022. If all options are
exercised, the Basic Contract will expire on October 15, 2027. (See FAR 52.216-18, 52.216-19 and 52.21622.) Task order performance can be performed up to October 15, 2032, which is past the basic contrac
expiration date, only when (1) orders are issued before October 15, 2027; and (2) options are included a
he initial issuance of the order. The FAR Clause 52.217–8 Option to Extend Services cannot be used to
extend work past October 15, 2032.
Accordingly, the cumulative term of CS3 Basic Contract may span up to 10 years. No individual task order
may exceed 10 years, inclusive of options, from the date the task order is placed; the cumulative term of
all task orders placed under CS3 may span up to 15 years.
For Example:
If a task order is placed on October 15, 2027, for 5 years (one-year base period with four one-year
option periods), the task order PoP would look like this:
●
●
●
●
●

One-Year Base Period: October 15, 2027 – October 14, 2028
First Option Period: October 15, 2028 – October 14, 2029
Second Option Period: October 15, 2029 – October 14, 2030
Third Option Period: October 15, 2030 – October 14, 2031
Forth Option Period: October 15, 2031 – October 14, 2032

After the CS3 Basic Contract term expires, CS3 will remain an active contract until the final task order is
closed-out and shall govern the terms and conditions with respect to active task orders to the same exten
as if they were completed during the CS3 Basic Contract term.

September 2022, v1.5

8

CS3 Customer Ordering Guide
Notwithstanding anything contrary to the above, an ordering agency may place a multi-year task order
under the CS3 Basic Contract; a task order using multi-year contracting methods must be consistent with
FAR Subpart 17.1 and any applicable funding restrictions.

3.4

Authorized Contract Users

Only authorized users may place orders under the Basic Contract. To become qualified as an authorized
user, a duly warranted Contracting Officer (as that term is defined in FAR Subpart 2.1) in good standing
must have an appropriate signed Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) issued from the GSA CS3
PCO. For purposes of this basic contract, these authorized users are identified as OCOs.
This Basic Contract is for use by all federal agencies, and others as listed in GSA Order OGP 4800.2I,
Eligibility to Use GSA Sources of Supply and Services, July 19, 2016, which is modified from time to time.
The most recent order as well as eligibility requirements can be found at GSA OGP Sources of Supplies
and Services.
OCOs must follow the ordering procedures of FAR 16.505, among others, with particular attention to the
Fair Opportunity procedures specified in FAR 16.505(b)(1) and the exceptions to Fair Opportunity in FAR
16.505(b)(2). Use of the GSA eBuy system by the OCO will ensure all Basic Contract holders are notified of
each task order request - eBuy is an electronic Request for Proposal (RFP) system designed to allow
government buyers to request information, find sources, and prepare RFPs for CS3 contracts completely
online. Information and instruction on the use of the eBuy system is furnished at GSA eBuy!.
Additional information on the use of eBuy can be found in Section 4.3 of this document.

GSA Management Fee

All ordering activities are charged a 2% contract access fee which should be included in all the CS3 CLINs
and not as a separate line item. The CS3 contractor pays the fee when it receives invoice payments from
he ordering agency.
For GSA Assisted Acquisition Ordering/Billing, an additional fee for acquisition assistance is negotiated
between the ordering agency and GSA; the CS3 contractor is not involved in the negotiation or collection
of the GSA Assisted Service Fee. See Section 4.2.3 for more information on GSA’s Assisted Acquisition
Services.

NOTE: guidance provided here does not supersede requirements of the FAR or agency FAR supplements
and policies. In all cases, the OCO must ensure complete adherence to the CS3 contract, applicable laws,
he FAR, and any additional agency policy and regulations.

4.2

Ordering and Billing Processes

The ordering agency has two options for placing task orders:
●
●

Direct Order/Direct Bill (see 4.2.2)
GSA Assisted Acquisition Services (see 4.2.3)

The subsequent subsections identify the required actions for each type of ordering. Delegation of
Procurement Authority is required for both ordering options.
4.2.1

Delegated Procurement Authority (DPA) Process

The ordering process begins with the Ordering Agency submitting the Delegation of Procurement
Authority (DPA) to GSA. It should be noted the DPA is required for each OCO who will be soliciting or
ordering services through the CS3 vehicle. Once an OCO has a DPA, he or she will not be required to submi
a request again, the DPA is valid for unlimited use. DPAs are unique to the holder and are non-transferable
from individual to individual or agency to agency.
Before requesting a DPA, the OCO must review the following documents available on the CS3 website a
GSA CS3 Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA):
1. Complex Commercial SATCOM Solutions (CS3) Customer Ordering Guide (this document)
2. DPA Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
Following the document review, the Ordering Agency OCO completes the online DPA Request Form and
submits the request to the GSA Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). Following review of the complete
DPA request form, the OCO issues the DPA, and the agency can begin issuing task orders.
If an OCO moves to a different Agency, they must inform the GSA CS3 PCO immediately. If a new DPA is
required, a new request form will be required and the PCO will expedite the request.
Questions regarding the DPA request process can be directed to CS3@gsa.gov.

September 2022, v1.5

CS3 Customer Ordering Guide
4.2.2

Direct Order/Direct Bill Ordering Process

Direct Order/Direct Bill orders are between the Ordering Agency and CS3 Contractor. GSA’s participation
in this process is limited to verifying the requirements are in scope (see 4.2.2.1) and providing a task order
ceiling determination (see 4.2.2.1).
The billing and payment for these services are conducted directly between the ordering agency and the
CS3 contractor. The OCO will be subject to the rules, regulations, and conditions promulgated and
enforced by that customer agency, the FAR, and the CS3 contract.
4.2.2.1 Develop SOW/PWS and Submit to GSA for Approval
The ordering agency OCO determines the needs and requirements ensuring they are clearly identified and
within scope. The OCO may seek interest in and information from the CS3 contractors on the requirements
(e.g., Request for Information, Market Research) to support development of the Statement of Work
(SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS).
Once requirements are established, the OCO will provide a written SOW/PWS to the GSA CS3 PCO and
GSA CS3 PM for review and approval. GSA will provide a scope determination to the OCO. Scope reviews
can be conducted by GSA and completed in parallel with the OCO's task order acquisition activities. The
Scope Determination process is as follows:
1. Forward a copy of the written SOW or PWS to the GSA CS3 PCO at the following email address:
CS3@gsa.gov.
2. Within five business days of receipt GSA will acknowledge receipt of the Scope Determination
request. Once the review is complete, the OCO is notified of the results of the Scope
Determination.
3. If the Scope Determination is negative, the OCO is contacted to provide guidance on the
appropriate scope for task orders under CS3. The OCO may be requested to prepare and issue a
revised Scope Determination request.
4. The OCO can request assistance and guidance as needed from the GSA CS3 PCO in the
development of the SOW/PWS by emailing them at CS3@gsa.gov.
5. The GSA CS3 PCO will provide the OCO with a determination as to whether the task order value
exceeds the cumulative CS3 program ceiling. It is the responsibility of the OCO to ensure funds
are verified and obligated.
6. For task orders requiring immediate delivery of service for an urgent requirement the OCO should
contact GSA for guidance at CS3@gsa.gov.
In addition to the SOW/PWS, the acquisition package created by the OCO should include:
1. Pricing structure/requirements, instructions, evaluation criteria, and order terms
2. Identify Information Security System requirements for Federal Information Security Managemen
Act (FISMA) Certification and Accreditations
3. Identify Personnel Security for both suitability (HSPD-12) and security clearance requirements in
he SOW/PWS

September 2022, v1.5

13

CS3 Customer Ordering Guide
4. Incorporate agency-specific requirements for DD Form 254 (see section 5 for more information
and links to forms)
5. Agency-specific security directives, guides, and procedures
4.2.2.2 Issue Solicitation
Request proposals from the contractor (e.g., Request for Proposal) using the acquisition package
developed with the SOW/PWS.
All task orders issued must use fair opportunity per FAR part 16.505 by providing equal consideration to
all CS3 contractors. The OCO must document the Fair Consideration method or sole source justification
The use of the GSA eBuy (GSA eBuy!) system is highly encouraged as it will ensure all eligible contractors
can participate in the task order solicitation.
4.2.2.3 Evaluate Proposals and Make Award
Formal evaluation plans or rating schemes are not required; however, the evaluation and acquisition plan
should match the value and complexity of the requirement. Once the ordering agency has finalized its
statement of work, said agency will request information in potential addition to a proposal directly from
he CS3 contractors.
4.2.2.4 Manage Task Order and Provide Product/Service
Once a task order award is made, the OCO collaborates with the Contractor to ensure the implementation
of products and services in accordance with the requirements of the award. Additional administration
duties include deliverable acceptance and approval, task order modifications, contractor performance
management, and task order close-out.
4.2.2.5 Closeout Task Order
The OCO for each task order will be responsible for closing out the order when completed. It is the
responsibility of the CS3 contractors to work in partnership with the government to closeout orders as
soon as possible by using procedures described in FAR 4.804. Notification of a completion of closeout of
a task order must be provided to the GSA CS3 PCO immediately upon closeout.
4.2.3

CS3 Customer Ordering Guide
b. Financial Management including verifying, obligating, and ensuring proper use of funds
c. Contract Closeou
The GSA Assisted Acquisition Fee is negotiated between GSA and the ordering agency and is based on a
percentage of the overall project value. The fee is on a sliding scale where the higher the project dollar
value the lower the fee. Payment of this Assisted Acquisition Fee is made directly to GSA by the ordering
agency using an Interagency Agreement (IA).
These agreements are the primary means by which GSA receives requests from federal agencies for
acquisition services.
GSA acceptance is required on all funding documents such as Purchase Request (PR); Intra-Governmental
Payment and Collection (IPAC) systems; and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).
More information on AAS along with their contact information can be found at https://aas.gsa.gov/.
1. Evaluate proposals (technical, price, or cost must be considered for each order in the selection
decision)
2. Select CS3 contractor
3. Place task order with selected CS3 contractor
4. Process task order close-ou

GSA eBuy

GSA's eBuy is designed to facilitate requests and submissions of proposals for commercial products,
services, and solutions offered through GSA for contracts such as Federal Supply Schedules and
Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). eBuy is a simple, user-friendly, web-based online
procurement tool that helps Federal Purchasers (buyers) achieve required competition, best pricing, and
value.
Buyers may prepare and post an RFP for specific CS3 products and services for a specified period. Once
posted, CS3 contractors may review the request and post their response. The first several screens are
provided below to provide a guide to the CS3 RFQ page. Further information on how to obtain a login and
use eBuy can be found on the eBuy web page at GSA eBuy!.

Security and Information Assurance

5.1 Security
To ensure the capability to respond to classified national security requirements, the CS3 Contract required
all contractors to obtain a Secret Facility Clearance with Secret level Safeguarding, and COMSEC
requirements. The DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification issued at the award of the
CS3 contract reflects these requirements.
Task orders that require and identify classified Facility, Safeguarding, special access, and COMSEC
requirements should be identified on the agency-specific DD Form 254 to be awarded at the Task Order
level. The Ordering Activity should ensure that the Contractor complies with all required security
regulations and provides personnel with appropriate clearances, as required at the Task Order level.
5.2 Information Assurance
To ensure compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 as implemented by
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 200 (FIPS 200), “Minimum Security Requirements
for Federal Information and Information Systems,” all contractors on the CS3 contract were required to
demonstrate their ability to meet Federal Government and Department of Defense requirements for
Information Assurance for information technology systems, to include: National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations,” NIST SP 800-37 “Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to
Federal Information Systems”, and the Committee on National Security Systems Policy(CNSSP) - 12,
“Cybersecurity Policy for Space Systems Used To Support National Security Missions”.
If required at the Task Order level, the Ordering Activity should assign an impact level (Low, Medium, or
High, per FIPS 200 and NIST SP 800-53) in the Statement of Work/Performance Work Statement. Task
Order evaluations should consider the extent to which the Contractor solution complies with the
necessary security controls based upon the assigned impact level, command encryption/authentication,
and other requirements in CNSSP 12.
The Contractor’s information assurance boundary is where the Contractor’s services connect to the user
erminals/equipment (i.e., includes satellite command encryption (ground and space); systems used in
he Satellite Operations Centers (SOCs), Network Operations Centers (NOCs), Business Support Systems
(BSS), and teleport; and terrestrial infrastructure required for service delivery). On a Task Order basis, the
Ordering Activity shall define the IA boundary in their Statement of Work or Performance Work Statemen
(PWS).

APPENDICES
Appendix A. Task Order Administration
Task Order Administration includes efforts associated with the operations and management of task orders
post-award: service implementation, task order modifications, contractor performance management,
and task order close-out.
The OCO for each task order will be responsible for closing out the order when completed. It is the
responsibility of the CS3 contractors to work in partnership with the government to closeout orders as
soon as possible by using procedures described in FAR 4.804. Notification of a completion of closeout of
a task order must be provided to the GSA CS3 PCO immediately upon closeout.

1.1

User Reporting Requirements
1.1.1

Contractor Performance

On an annual basis ordering agencies must evaluate how the contractor performed in accordance with
contract requirements such as the following:
●
●
●
●
●
●

quality of service
cost control/efficiencies
schedule/timeliness
management/customer service/oversigh
regulatory compliance
small business subcontracting (if applicable)

Ordering agencies should use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) at
CPARS to review contractor performance during source selection evaluations.
Information obtained from CPARS evaluations may be shared with government agencies for use in suppor
of future award decisions (FAR 42.15).
The customer agency is required by FAR 42.1502 policy to complete past performance records for the
contractor on at least an annual basis and when work under a contract or order is complete. From timeto-time, the GSA CS3 PCO may inquire about contractor performance by survey or telephone call.

1.2

Socioeconomic Credit – FPDS NG Reporting

Ordering agencies are required to report all orders greater than the micro-purchase threshold in the
Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation (FPDS-NG) system in accordance with FAR 4.6. Every
modification regardless of dollar value must also be reported. Proper reporting ensures socioeconomic
credit will be received. For assistance with FPDS, please contact the FPDS-NG Helpdesk at FSD or 866-6068220.

1.3

Contract Modification

Contract modification to the basic CS3 contracts may be required over the course of the CS3 period of
performance. Contract modifications may take the form of a strategic modification or a contractor
modification. A strategic modification is one that is made to all CS3 contracts; an example could be a
modification that adds new technology to the CS3 contract. On the other hand, a contractor modification
is geared towards a specific CS3 contract, and such an example would include a modification to recognize
a contractor’s change of name. Each CS3 contractor is responsible for maintaining the CS3 contract on its
public website that reflects all basic CS3 contract modifications. Additionally, it should be noted the
contractor can and may post each contract modification separately.
Task order modifications may be necessary during the task order period to address additional
requirements or administrative changes. The OCO should follow the FAR and guidance of their Agencyspecific FAR supplement and other guidance.

1.4

Task Order (Contract) Closeout

It is the OCO’s responsibility to closeout task orders, and such closeout shall be accomplished within the
guidelines set forth in:
●
●
●

FAR Part 4.8 Government Contract Files.
FAR Part 42 Contract Administration and Audit Services.
GSAM Subpart 504.8 Government Contract Files.

The contractor agrees to cooperate with the OCO to close out task orders after expiration, cancellation,
or termination.
