## TASK ORDER TEMPLATE
Functional Area I: Multifunction Device and Network Printer
Fleet Assessmen
TEMPLATE 3: Vendor Neutral Recommendations and Bill of Material Creation
Template 3 is designed for the purpose of procuring fleet assessment services focused
on developing functional specifications and salient characteristics for print outpu
devices that can be used in the procurement and implementation process for new
devices.. The deliverables produced from this Task Order Template will be a Bill of
Materials and/or Service Level Agreement standards that will be incorporated into a
MFD and NP Request for Quote and Statement of Work. .
(Enter Ordering Activity Agency Name)
(The following is an example of a Performance Work Statement)
DATE: (Enter date)
Background: Describe background information about your agency’s requirements. The
definition of an “imaging fleet” is the sum of all devices that print, copy, scan, or fax a
hard copy document within a defined environment. Describe your agency’s “imaging
fleet”.
Include the size of the organization, current knowledge about the state of the MFD and
NP environment, and operational responsibility for the MFD and NP fleet.
Provide basic background on the overall objectives of the FA II procurement that will be
issued using the information produced in this procurement. General objectives may
include:
•
•
•

Replacement of legacy fleet devices
Reduction in the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the flee
Improved operational efficiencies through technological advancements and
strategic device placemen

•
•

Movement towards document management solutions through increased
echnological capabilities
Improvement in key sustainability aspects including energy and paper
consumption, GHG emissions, and recyclability

1.0 Statement of Work
Contract Type: State the type of order i.e. Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials etc.
hat is applicable for this contract action. For information on contract types refer to FAR
Part 16.
Geographical Location/Place of Performance: Indicate all locations in which the
contractor is being asked to perform or state that it will be at the contractor’s facilities. If
necessary, identify the main location(s), and approximately how far away any secondary
locations are. Identify normal working hours and how you wish to address overtime or
extra hours.
Period of Performance: Indicate the length of this project by using one of the following
methods:
Method 1: Work to be performed in a specific time period with a period of performance
of five years or less. The base period for this order is from (insert the date and year)
hrough (insert the date and year) or one year from date of delivery and/or installation,
with four available twelve month option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the
government. Total of base period and option periods shall not exceed 5 years. The
exercising of the options should begin 60 to 90 days prior to expiration date.
Method 2: Multi-year period of performance - Used when the need for supplies or
services is non-severable and continuing over a period greater than one year. The
period of performance shall not exceed 5 years.
Site Visit: If applicable – provide site visit information. If a site visit is not required
please mark this section N/A or Reserved.

Scope of Work
Depending on the size of the fleet to be assessed, contractors may or may
not make use of automated data collection agents (DCA’s) that assist in the
information gathering process. Agencies should clearly identify any issues
hat may exist regarding the use of DCA’s.
Using the objectives of the future FA II procurements that will be executed
as a result of the work performed here, agencies should outline the specific
work that is being requested. Agencies should identify the format and
content of the vendor-neutral recommendations that are being sought.
General content to be considered includes but is not necessarily limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Classifications of devices (MFD, NP, A3, A4, etc.)
Minimum output speed and monthly capacity
B&W vs. Color
Paper handling capability
Finishing capability
Recommended configuration using standard industry offerings
Security features
Network connectivity
Scanning capability

•
•

Service Level Agreement (SLA) recommendations using FSSI SLA’s
as a baseline
CLIN recommendations based on FSSI FA II CLIN structure

Agencies should describe the format of the recommendations that are to be made
as a result assessment process with the expectation that the overall content will
eventually be incorporated into future bills of materials (BOM).

RFQ Considerations:
Carefully consider whether the Task Order will be procured using a Performance
Based Services approach. If the Contracting Officer intends to use Performance
Based Contracting methods the Contracting Officer must consider how to
implement and use a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. The Ordering Activity
may utilize a system of incentives and disincentives rather than a pass/fail
approach given their preferences.
The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer is responsible for developing the
methodology for evaluating order quotations. Some options to consider are:
•
•

Acceptable/Unacceptable Technical Offers that are the lowest price and
meet or exceed salient performance characteristics
Other technical factors are more highly valued by the government than price
