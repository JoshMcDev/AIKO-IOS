(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the
contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies,
o the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals—
(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or
had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in
connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the
submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or
destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws,
or receiving stolen property;
(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a
Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of
his clause; and
(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any
delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains
unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been
assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial
challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined
until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer
has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is no
delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212,
which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a
delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
his will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability,
and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to
request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
o the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the
axpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
axpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159.
The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.
The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquen
because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
