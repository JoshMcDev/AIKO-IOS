Purpose:
There are 3 Special Item Numbers (SIN) that are construction-related that have additional
considerations beyond FAR 8.4 buying procedures. This customer guide explains those
considerations and when you might use these 3 SINs for construction-related requirements.
They are:
Ancillary Repair and Alterations (SIN ANCRA)
Installation and Site Preparation (SIN 238910)
Roofing Products and Services Solution (SIN 238160)

Common considerations for all 3 SINS:
-

Applicable clauses associated with FAR Subpart 22.4 have been incorporated into these
SINs; however, non SCA/SCLA specific wage determinations have not. Any Applicable DavisBacon wage determinations need to be added at the order-level for all 3 SINs.

-

Be cognizant about any agency-specific approvals, thresholds, or funding restrictions
associated with real property work, such as, the use of operation and maintenance (O&M)
funds for unspecified military construction.

-

The RFQ and order shall inform of any bonding requirements and required insurance
amounts, and include any applicable bonding provisions and clauses.

-

All 3 SINs exclude:
o (1) major or new construction of buildings, roads, parking lots and other facilities
o (2) complex repair/alteration of entire facilities or significant portions of facilities
o (3) Architectural Engineering Services (A&E) under the Brooks Architect-Engineers
Act as stated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36 (see FAR 36.601-4(a))

-

The CO may require a warrant for construction – this is agency/ordering organization
specific

Criteria to use SIN:
1) Work is incidental to the requiremen
The ANCRA SIN’s repair and alteration services are not to be the sole or primary purpose of the
requirement. This is not a standalone SIN and its services are in support of the requiremen
from another SIN. The services shall be on the same order as the primary product or service.
2) Work is Not Complex or Related to a Significant Portion of the Facility
The following shall be considered when determining complexity and significance:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Primary purpose of the work;
Dollar value of ancillary repair and alteration in relation to other SIN(s) used
Duration of project;
Variety of trades involved;
Change in structural functionality (e.g., load-bearing walls, floor loading, etc.);
Change in space quality (e.g., heating, cooling, etc.);
Project activities (e.g., amount of dust and debris, noise abatement, loading dock
availability, material transport and storage, employee swing space, coordination with

tenants, potential of damage to building, security escorts, etc.); and
● Special situations (e.g., historic buildings, asbestos, lead paint, PCBs, storage tanks, etc.).
It is the responsibility of the ordering activity Contracting Officer (CO) to determine complexity
and scope. If the work is determined to be complex, the ANCRA SIN cannot be used.
3) Work is Not in a GSA Public Building Service (PBS) leased space
4) GSA PBS approval has been obtained if desired work is in Federally owned space managed by
## GSA PBS
Only PBS has the legal authority to delegate ancillary repair and alteration work for PBS managed
buildings. Written approval is required before an order can be placed using this SIN. When the
value of the work is greater than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, the ordering organization
must provide the MAS contractor written evidence of delegation of authority signed by the PBS
Regional Administrator (RA).
4a) Inspection of Ancillary Repair and Alterations Work
Upon completion of any ancillary repair and alteration work performed in federally owned
space managed by PBS, the work must be inspected by the PBS’s building manager and/or
Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) (to verify that the work conforms to the building
standards) before payment is submitted to the MAS contractor.

sustainable, energy efficient/savings solutions, and installation and site preparation in conjunction
with products for the repair or replacement of a roof.
