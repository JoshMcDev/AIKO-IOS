1.2

BACKGROUND

The mission of NIWC Atlantic is to identify, develop, deliver and sustain information warfare capabilities in support
of naval, joint, coalition and other national missions. To meet this, NIWC Atlantic requires the services outlined in
his performance work statement to support and sustain the facilities described below.
NIWC Atlantic has two facility locations in Louisiana (LA). These buildings are located at the University of New
Orleans Technology Park. The first building consists of 107,000 square feet (sf) of administrative space. The
second building consists of 107,000 sq. ft. of administrative, lab and warehouse space including a data center and
help desk.
NIWC Atlantic has four facility locations in South Carolina (SC). The majority of the facilities, buildings totaling
790,000 sf, are located on the South Annex of the Naval Weapon Station (NWS), Charleston, SC. An additional
602,000 sq. ft. is located four miles away on the former Charleston Naval Base. In addition, there is a 5,000 square
foot building located on Sullivan’s Island, SC, 26 miles away, and 3,500 sq. ft. at Poseidon Park in Goose Creek, 10
miles away.
NIWC Atlantic has five facility locations in Virginia (VA). This is represented by 270,096 sq. ft. on St. Julien's
Creek Annex in Portsmouth, VA; 196,089 sq. ft. on the Norfolk Naval Station which is 10 miles from Portsmouth;
102,250 sq. ft. on the Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek, VA, which is 20 miles from Portsmouth, VA; and 4,750
sq. ft. on the Naval Support Activity Norfolk which is 2 miles from the main Norfolk Naval Station.
NIWC Atlantic buildings were constructed between 1918 and 2016. They can be grouped into four categories:
administrative (690,000 sf), laboratories (572,000 sf), production (131,000 sf) and staging/storage (267,000 sf). The
population in these facilities is estimated to be approximately 6,200. All building counts, distances, and square
footages in the preceding paragraphs are approximate.

Page 9 of 75
Administrative space for personnel consists of open floor areas with system furniture workstations and private
offices. In addition, at the South Carolina facilities there are specialty rooms, including but not limited to an
electronic board room, theater, conference center, fitness room, interactive training rooms, and message center.
Laboratory space is for research, development, design, integration, operation, testing, and life cycle support of
C4ISR systems, Information Technology and Space capabilities. Production space ranges from the fabrication of
portable electronic systems in carrying cases to integration of electronic systems into 50,000-lb armored vehicles.
Staging/storage space accommodates inventory ranging from a small transistor to a complete radar system. In
addition to buildings, NIWC Atlantic facilities include towers, antenna farms, radars and test ranges.

Page 10 of 75
2.1.1

Access to Government Facilities

NIWC Atlantic and other Government installations have restricted access. Contractors are limited to access during
certain days and times as specified in the Workweek requirements of this task order. If access to the assigned
Government facility is restricted due to safety/security exercise, an Executive Order, or an administrative leave
determination applying to the local activity (e.g., inclement weather), the contractor, in agreement with the COR,
shall make alternative work arrangements. The contractor shall adjust work schedule, work at an alternate location,
or if alternate work arrangements cannot be accommodated, the contractor shall notify the COR of the inability to
access the assigned facility prior to charging their time to the task order as direct cost provided such charges are
consistent with the contractor’s accounting practices. The ability to work at an alternate location that is not a
Government or contractor facility site is dependent on the contractor having an alternative work site agreement with
he employee. The ability to work at an alternate location may not be an option for certain support services.
2.1.2

Training Requirements and Exercise Support

Contractor personnel working full-time or partially at a Government facility shall complete all applicable training
requirements as specified under Mandatory Training, PWS Para 8.0. Contractor personnel may also be required to
participate in safety, security (e.g., Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (AT/FP)), and operational training exercises
(possibly two per year). Applicable contractor personnel shall support and participate in the training exercise which
may include role-playing and reacting to exercise injects based on the situation or exercise objectives.
2.1.3

Alternate Work Locations from Government Facilities

The ability to provide support from an alternate location versus from a Government facility is dependent on the type
of support provided, the contractor employee’s ability and trustworthiness, and the company’s employment policy.
The ability to work at an alternate location is not an option for all positions and personnel. The ultimate decision to
allow work performed at an alternate work location will be determined by the COR. If allowed, a contractor
employee may work at an alternate location if their company has defined minimum criteria consisting of secure
connectivity access and an established signed agreement between the company and employee. Contractor
employees requesting an alternate location shall submit a request to the COR that includes the time and date the
work will be accomplished; the nature of the work with the referenced support task order PWS paragraph; the reason
he work must be accomplished at an alternate location; and include a copy of their company agreement for the
contract files. The Government reserves the right to disallow any billable hours by contractor employees working a
an alternative work location without Government approval and the Government reserves the right to discontinue the
ability to work from an alternate location at any time.
2.2

CONTRACTOR FACILITIES

The contractor can have its facility location anywhere as long as the location does not present a hardship to complete
work required on task. The contractor shall have real-time communication between the contractor personnel
supporting the efforts and Government personnel available at time of award.
3.0

D. SEB Evaluation Procedures
All quotations will be received by the Contract Specialist no later than the hour and date given in the RFQ. Upon
receipt of quotations, the Contract Specialist should conduct an initial screening to ascertain that each quoter has
submitted all of the required information in the quantities and format specified in the RFQ. The Contract Specialis
will retain the original quotations and associated data for the contract file. If the review indicates a quotation may be
subject to rejection for any reason (after contracting has performed its screening and before the evaluation begins),
he PCO/SSA will document as required to support the rejection.
The agency will first calculate the total proposed price of each quotation and place them in descending order based
on price, and then begin evaluating technical submissions, starting with the lowest-priced quote. If the lowest-priced
submission receives an acceptable technical rating, it will be considered the best value, and "award" may be made
without further consideration of any other quoters. However, if the lowest priced quote receives a technical rating of
less than acceptable, then the next lowest-priced quote will be evaluated. This process will continue until a quote is
determined to be technically acceptable. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the Government reserves the right to
review a technical submission other than the lowest price technically acceptable submission to assist with the price
reasonableness determination.
In order for a quoter to be considered for award, the quotation must receive an “acceptable” rating in the non-price
Factor (and Subfactors). A quotation receiving a rating of “unacceptable” in the non-price Factor (and Subfactors)
will not be eligible for award.
The evaluation of the non-price Factor (and Subfactors) will consist of (1) a written summary and (2) a rating in
accordance with the solicitation criteria.

on price, and then begin evaluating technical submissions, starting with the lowest-priced quote. If the lowest-priced
submission receives an “acceptable” technical rating, it will be considered the best value, and "award" may be made
without further consideration of any other quotations. However, if the lowest priced quote receives a technical
rating of “unacceptable”, then the next lowest-priced quotation will be evaluated. This process will continue until a
quotation is determined to be technically “acceptable”. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the Governmen
reserves the right to review a technical submission other than the lowest price technically acceptable submission to
assist with the price reasonableness determination.
The Government intends to make award based on the initial proposal submissions without conducting interchanges.
Therefore, each quote should contain the quoter’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the
Government reserves the right to hold interchanges if, during the evaluation, it is determined to be in the bes
interest of the Government. Interchanges are fluid interaction(s) between the Contracting Officer (CO) and the
quoters that may address any aspect of the proposal and may or may not be documented in real time. Quoter
responses to interchanges will be considered in making the order selection decision. Interchanges may be conducted
with one, some or all offerors as the Government is not required to conduct interchanges with any or all contractors
responding to this RFQ.
A quote must be acceptable for the quoter to be eligible for award. QUOTATIONS THAT DO NOT CONFORM
## TO THE REQUIREMENTS STATED HEREIN MAY BE DETERMINED UNACCEPTABLE AND MAY BE
REJECTED WITHOUT FURTHER EVALUATION.
## EVALUATION FACTORS

1) Quotes will be evaluated on the evaluation factors listed below. The Government will evaluate quotations for
acceptability, but will not rank the quotations by the non-price factors or subfactors.
Factor A Technical
a) SubFactor 1: Technical Approach
b) SubFactor 2: Staffing Plan
Factor A Technical (SubFactors 1 Technical Approach and 2 Staffing Plan) will be rated on an
“acceptable” / “unacceptable” basis as described below. The Government’s technical evaluation team shall
evaluate the technical quotations on an “acceptable” or “unacceptable” basis, assigning one of the ratings
described below for each subfactor. Any subfactor evaluated as “unacceptable” will render the entire
quotation “unacceptable” and, therefore, unawardable. Only those quotations determined to be technically
“acceptable”, either initially or as a result of discussions (if opened), will be considered for award.
However, quoters are reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the
initial quote, as received, without discussions.
