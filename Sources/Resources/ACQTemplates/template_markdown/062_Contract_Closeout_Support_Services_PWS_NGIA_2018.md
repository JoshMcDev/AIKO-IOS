GSA partnered with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to offer products in support of the
CDM (Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring) Program. The hardware and software
products and associated services offered by GSA undergo a DHS CISA produc
qualification process to be added to the CDM Approved Products List (APL). To make
hem easier to identify, CDM approved products are depicted in GSA Advantage!® with

. The full complement of the CDM offerings include tools,
associated maintenance, and other related services, such as training. CDM tools are
listed within four CDM Capability Areas DHS CISA’s Approved Product List found a

Product Ordering Process
Purchases can be made through GSA Advantage!®, and you can search for products
and vendors on the IT Security Aisle on GSA Advantage!®, or by issuing a Request for
Quote (RFQ) to allow vendors to respond to your well defined requirements. An RFQ
may be issued through GSA’s eBuy, an electronic RFQ system that is part of the suite
of on-line tools which complement GSA Advantage!®. eBuy allows ordering
organizations to post requirements, obtain quotes, and issue orders.
State, local, tribal, and territorial government entities can use eBuy to post RFQs for
CDM Tools under the Cooperative Purchasing Program. Agencies should also comply
with their organization's respective acquisition rules.
The Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Desk Reference provides detailed information on
making acquisitions from GSA’s programs. For information on SAT and guidance on
acquisition requirements, please reference the resources available on the “Websites
and tools for MAS buyers” webpage.

Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Tools Ordering Procedure

Ordering Process for the CDM Tools
The following section provides guidance on determining your product requirements as
well as making acquisitions of CDM Tools.
1. Determine Requirements
a. Determine your requirements/products for purchase, including manufacturer
part/item number, manufacturer name, product service name, and quantity. The
following resources can help you determine this information:
i. GSA Advantage!® CDM Tools vendor listing can help you quickly identify and
filter for the CDM attribute. Items with the CDM symbol
differentiate CDM
products and vendors. Browse the industry partners catalog or their price lists
on GSA Advantage!®, which will offer details such as delivery area,
environmental attributes, and warranties.
ii. The CDM APL provides a current comprehensive source for all CDM
approved products.
b. Determine if a SOW is required for purchase of related services such as
maintenance, training, or installation.
c. Determine whether your acquisition is below the SAT.
2. Purchases Under the SAT
a. For acquisitions needing a SOW, follow the steps to create a SOW in this link:
FAR 8.405-2 Ordering Procedures for Services Requiring a statement of work.
For CDM Tools purchases, a SOW may be required if installation, maintenance,
or training services are needed along with the CDM product purchase.
b. Follow all FAR guidelines for making Simplified Acquisitions, including FAR
8.405-1 Ordering procedures for supplies, and services not requiring a statemen
of work.
c. Use the GSA Advantage!® CDM Tools vendor listing, or review the IT Security
Aisle on GSA Advantage!®, and click on the drop down for the CDM vendor
listing pages. Searches within this page are filtered to show only CDM Tools SIN
products and vendors. Select the vendor(s) and product(s) of your choice and
make your CDM Tools purchase from GSA Advantage®.
3. Develop Solicitation for Acquisitions Above the SAT
a. Draft and issue the RFQ. The RFQ shall specify the type of order and include
any options and any supplemental agency clauses as applicable (e.g., DFARS

GSA/FAS/ITC/IT Products
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Tools Ordering Procedure

for DoD). Follow the eBuy Buyer Job Aid, which will guide you through issuing an
RFQ. Posting an RFQ on eBuy is one medium for providing fair notice in
accordance with FAR 8.405-2 ordering procedures for schedules.
b. For acquisitions needing a SOW, follow the steps to create a SOW in FAR 8.4052 Ordering Procedures for Services Requiring a statement of work. For CDM
Tools purchases, a SOW may be required if installation, maintenance, or training
services are needed along with the CDM product purchase.
i. Access your eBuy account on GSA Advantage!®. Search for the approved
CDM product you are looking for under the appropriate ITC SIN. (See the
CDM APL at cisa.gov/cdm-apl)
ii. Select at least three of the CDM Product vendors.
iii. Provide RFQ information on the products you want.
iv. Attach the SOW and other needed documents.
c. Evaluate the responses you receive.
Use GSA eLibrary to research the industry partners and their detailed contrac
information.
d. Make the award through your organization’s procurement or contract writing
system or issue the order electronically through GSA eBuy.
