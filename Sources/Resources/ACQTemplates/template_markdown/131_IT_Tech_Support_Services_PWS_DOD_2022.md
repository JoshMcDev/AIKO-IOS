A. Introduction to SIN 518210C
The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) are long-term governmentwide contracts with
commercial firms providing federal, state, and local government buyers access to more than 11
million commercial supplies (products) and services at volume discount pricing.
MAS contains the Special Item Number (SIN) 518210C, Cloud Computing and Cloud Related
Information Technology (IT) Professional Services, specifically for just cloud services authorized
vendors. SIN 518210C may be utilized by federal Ordering Activities as well as state, local,
ribal organizations, certain educational institutions, international organizations, and other
eligible users outlined in GSA Order OGP 4800.2I.
SIN 518210C contains over four hundred authorized vendors of cloud computing services as of
June 2022, and growing. It also includes cloud related IT professional (labor) services.
Therefore, Ordering Activities may solicit to contractors providing SIN 518210C on their
schedule contract to find cloud services and cloud related IT cloud professional services (labor).
SIN 518210C contains only cloud services that meet the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) definition of cloud. When multiple requirements are needed, Ordering
Activities should only select SIN 518210C when submitting a RFQ on eBuy and state tha
authorized contractors may utilize other SINs to create a complete solution. Examples would be
soliciting the Software SIN (SIN 511210) for software that is not cloud based (and so does not fi
he NIST definition) but runs in the cloud and/or manages other cloud offerings, or the
Hardware SIN (SIN 33411) for private cloud requirements since no hardware for private clouds
is listed on the SIN 518210C.
This SIN 518210C Ordering Guide will only provide guidance to Ordering Activities. It will no
prescribe or limit what cloud services contractors provide, nor is it binding to Ordering Activities
as they will have to execute in accordance with their Ordering Activity policies and practices.
This Guide is intended to be a living document and will be updated periodically, as needed.
For a deeper discussion of the topics discussed in this guide, please refer to the GSA MAS
Desk Reference.

B. SIN 518210C Cloud Computing and Cloud
Related IT Professional Services Explained
1. Cloud Computing Defined
For this document we use the definition of "cloud" by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-145 The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing.
Traditionally an Ordering Activity would purchase hardware and/or software infrastructure
outright as well as unboxing it, racking, stacking and wiring it, configuring it, etc. With cloud
computing, an Ordering Activity remotely orders virtual machines, applications and more at the
ouch of a button.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition of cloud computing is
broken down into these five distinct characteristics:
●
●

●
●

●

On Demand Self Service – A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such
as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human
interaction with each service provider.
Rapid Elasticity – Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the
consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be
appropriated in any quantity at any time.
Broad Network Access – Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through
standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g.,
mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
Resource Pooling – The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple
consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically
assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location
independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exac
location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of
abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage,
processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
Measured Service – Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by
leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service
(e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer
of the utilized service.

To be considered cloud computing by this definition, the cloud service must possess all of the
above five characteristics.

6

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

There are three primary cloud service models you can purchase:
●

●

●

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – The capability provided to the consumer is to provision
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and
applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure bu
has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited
control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
PaaS (Platform as a Service) – The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the
cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming
languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does no
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration
settings for the application-hosting environment.
SaaS (Software as a Service) – The capability provided to the consumer is to use the
provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure . The applications are accessible from
various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., webbased email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying
cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual
application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user specific application
configuration settings.

You must also choose a deployment model. Deployment models detail how many separate,
multi-tenants are in the cloud environment and what the relationship between these tenants is.
There are four NIST cloud deployment models:
●
●
●

●

Public Cloud – The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It
may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization,
or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
Private Cloud – The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single
organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed,
and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of SIN 518210C.
Community Cloud – The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security
requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and
operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some
combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
Hybrid Cloud – The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound
ogether by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability
(e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

2. How Cloud Computing is Sold
Most of the cloud computing pricing models require careful analysis by Ordering Activity personnel
based on the unique attributes of their acquisition. Many pricing models require ongoing monitoring of
usage and available funding. See the discussion on choosing contract types later in this document for
guidance on using a not-to-exceed (NTE) ceiling price by CLIN.

●
●

IaaS/PaaS priced by the Increment (e.g., transaction, Minute, Seconds, Hours or Days), for
central processing units (CPUs), storage or memory for virtual machines in the cloud
environment. Depending on the contract type awarded, this may cause invoices to vary from
month to month. In the case of communications application programming interface (API)
platforms that charge by short message service (SMS) message/email sent or voice minutes
used.
SaaS priced by the Seat (e.g., application user seat), most commonly by the seat per month or
seat per year.
SaaS priced by the Transaction (e.g., up/download, operation), as in the case of large online
databases. Login may or may not be free of charges, but a per transaction charge accrues
whenever the customer issues a query against that large database (e.g., real estate or scientific
applications). Another example, for SaaS, might be a charge for each read/write disk operation,
sometimes sold in dollars per 10M operations, etc.
IaaS/PaaS priced by Data Transport, is calculated from the transport of data into/within/out of
he data center.
IaaS/PaaS priced by Service Term (e.g., time period), sometimes called “reservations,”
“reserved instances” (RIs), “committed use” or “savings plans”, each CSP has their own specific
erm for the offering. For the purpose of this document we will refer to them as the generic
erm “cloud reservations”. These are commitments to purchase compute capacity, or buckets
of transactions, needed for your Ordering Activity over a defined and agreed to period of time,
usually in exchange for a discount. Cloud reservations are allowed per the GSA MAS
Solicitation, as long as they are paid for in arrears (31 U.S.C. 3324). They are recommended for
workloads that have steady or predictable usage patterns. These “cloud reservations” offer a
discount against on-demand pricing (per minute, etc.) depending on length of term, whereas
volume discounts offer a tiered discount that depends on certain thresholds.

C. SIN 518210C Ordering Guide Steps
1. Perform Market Research
There are many ways to perform market research: GSA’s Market Research as a Service
(MRAS), Small Business Administration (SBA) resources, Defense Acquisition University (DAU)
resources, etc. You are encouraged to look at the options that align with your Ordering Activity’s
needs.
GSA’s Market Research as a Service (MRAS) Tool lessens much of the frustration that the back and
forth market research process may have. MRAS utilizes the latest automated research techniques to
collect authorized vendor response data. This no-cost service cross-indexes Ordering Activity
requirements against authorized contractors on SIN 518210C that support cloud.
To initiate a MRAS, an Ordering Activity will:
1. Engage their GSA Customer Service Director (CSD): Contact your CSD who
will help guide you through this process.
2. Request a Scope Review: The GSA CSD and the Subject Matter Experts
(SMEs) for the applicable GSA vehicle will review the requirement to determine if
it is within scope of one of the various GSA contracts (Governmentwide
Acquisition Contract (GWAC), OASIS, MAS, VETS2, etc.).

8

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

3. Request a Request for Information (RFI) from MRAS team: The GSA CSD
and Ordering Activity will together fill out a short requirements questionnaire so
hat the MRAS team can create a RFI.
GSA will then publish a market research RFI on behalf of the Ordering Activity, allowing GSA to
gather authorized contractor responses for an agreed upon period of time. After that time
elapses, GSA collects and collates the results and delivers a report to the Ordering Activity. The
report details the total number of interested authorized contractors, their relevant GSA contracts
specific to the requirements, their socioeconomic profiles, their business size, their responses to
specific yes/no technical questions, and more. Check out full MRAS samples here (A, B).
The responses gathered from the market research may cause you to rethink choices of contrac
ype and other requirements. In that case you must loop back to revise your requirements.

2. Draft Your Requirements
a. Application Rationalization
The authorized Ordering Activity should first complete the Application Rationalization
(AppRat) process. This typically includes:
●
●
●
●
●
●

inventorying the digital environment
assessing which applications are cloud ready and which are no
determining which are high strategic business value
discovering which are underutilized
seeing which should be kept and which should be retired
finding system/services inter-decencies required supporting services/data

Once the Application Rationalization process has been completed, it is time for the
program/technical team, along with the acquisition team, to draft the formal cloud
services requirements and acquisition strategy.
If an Ordering Activity chooses to use cloud professional services for the Application
Rationalization process, it is recommended to do this as a standalone award, and tha
deliverable becomes the requirements for a second award to execute the migration to a
CSP’s cloud. Also, the authorized Ordering Activity can require demonstrated
experience with similar size, scope, and subject matter expertise of projects, with
applicable CSP certifications, if available.

b. Consider a Cloud Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)
Ordering Activities can award BPAs (FAR 8.405-3) against the GSA MAS SIN 518210C.
Ordering Activities award BPAs (i.e., multiple award or single award (see limitations: GSA, FAR
8.405-3)) when an authorized Ordering Activity defines requirements (e.g., business,
operations, security, technical) that allow the authorized Ordering Activity to issue BPA awards
o authorized contractors that meet the BPA requirements. The authorized Ordering Activity,
and other authorized Ordering Activities, can then use the BPA to compete TOs against the
BPA awardees. The TOs inherit the BPA requirements and can include additional requirements
or further define and delineate the requirements (e.g., quantities). An awarded TO results in the
9

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

legally binding "contract" between the Ordering Activity and the authorized contractor. (Note:
Per FAR 8.405-3, they are referred to as TOs, not Orders, as SIN 518210C is a service, not a
product.) When any TO is created, decisions about contract type and funding type could be
made at that time depending on the nature of the cloud computing requirement.

c. Acquisition Strategies
●

Distributed/Office Level: Supports a distinct and individual TO for specific, defined, and known
set of requirements.
Here, the cloud services acquisition journey begins with what can be the most difficult step for
some: defining your cloud service requirements. Requirements must be developed for each
application so that they can be cloud-migrated or cloud-developed (i.e, Application
Rationalization). The result is that the target cloud architecture is defined for each application
before it is migrated to the appropriate/available cloud environment(s). This structured projec
process is no different from a non-cloud project.

●

Enterprise/Chief Information Officer (CIO) Level: Development of a BPA that defines
baseline requirements for specific recurring needs of an Ordering Activity with TO(s) awarded
under the BPA for specific quantities and deliverable times.
Here the cloud services acquisition journey begins with reviewing current Ordering
Activity cloud utilization and defining the overall goals and objectives of establishing an
enterprise-wide purchasing vehicle (centralization, governance, risk management, cos
savings, etc.).

●

Other acquisition strategies to consider:
○

Best practice is to separate the procurement of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS,
SaaS) from the cloud related IT professional services (labor) often associated
with the cloud (e.g., architecting, migration, configuration etc.). Awarding the IT
professional services to a different Authorized Contractor may provide unbiased
support. This provides the greatest flexibility in utilizing in-house resources
(Ordering Activity or contractor) with the best knowledge of existing systems for
delivering professional services.

○

Before seeking to leverage emerging technologies, conduct due diligence to
ensure the likelihood of success. Untested emerging technologies may not mee
early expectations for performance or may not integrate into Ordering Activity
operations as initially anticipated. Ordering Activities should evaluate which
services are available that meet Ordering Activity/federal security requirements.

d. The Cloud Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)
The primary way in determining if "a price is reasonable'' is to develop a cost estimate
(e.g., IGCE) and evaluate proposals in comparison to the developed cost estimate. The
Ordering Activity should check with their own internal supplemental acquisition
regulations, policies, and the FAR to understand if an IGCE is required for their specific
cloud services procurement. Typically, the Ordering Activity must first estimate the value

10

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

of the acquisition and if that estimated value exceeds the Simplified Acquisition
Threshold (SAT), then they are required to conduct market research.
An IGCE is a complex undertaking for cloud services as individual cloud stock keeping
units (SKUs) need to be compared in an apples-to-apples way since they are sometimes
ied to a specific authorized contractor. If available, universal product codes (UPCs)
should be used at the CSP level when comparing products. Best practice is to ask the
CSP or authorized reseller the structure of their cloud service offerings and how they
map across their commercial cloud services ecosystem.
Another suggestion is to create a set of technical requirements for the entire portfolio of
Ordering Activity applications to be hosted in the cloud. Then, visit the websites of
several CSPs and use the CSPs’ online calculators to help create the IGCE. The
calculators provide public pricing that can be used in conjunction with other sources for
compiling an IGCE. These calculators are another tool in an Ordering Activity’s tool kit,
but Ordering Activities should also attempt to find other ways to INDEPENDENTLY
estimate costs. Note: not all CSPs price their solutions in the same manner; it is
important to clearly understand how each CSP prices offerings, costs elements and noncost elements. It takes time to research, understand, and map those elements to your
IGCE.
When performing a price analysis during market research, consider an approach with
emphasis on pursuing volume discounts (which may be a tiered set of discounts based
on volume vs. fixed discounts) and enterprise-wide pricing. Ordering activities can
maximize cost savings by driving Ordering Activity cloud service customers toward an
enterprise-wide cloud computing ordering approach (e.g., two-three Ordering Activitywide cloud orders or BPAs managed by one program office) instead of each program
office issuing individual orders for cloud computing. Similarly, consolidating various IT
services under fewer contracts can also generate volume discounts. Like with any other
product or service, true savings for cloud computing is realized when customers
combine their cloud services requirements and leverage their buying power as a large
volume customer. The Ordering Activity CIO (under Federal Information Technology
Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)) has to approve these actions to ensure enterprise
level deployment.

e. Choice of Contract Type
The contract type suggestions below are for GSA MAS Solicitation cloud services (e.g.,
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) plus associated tools for automated managed services which are
often billed as SaaS. The choice of contract type (i.e., fixed price, labor, or time-andmaterial) for cloud related IT professional services (work performed by humans), should
be considered separately. To learn more, please reference the “GSA Multiple Award
Schedule Ordering Guide Quick Reference Summer 2020”.
It’s important that the Ordering Activity identifies if the cloud services will have a baseline
utilization that does not fluctuate over the period of performance, or if utilization will have
high fluctuation/surge that would benefit from consumption/utilization-based pricing. This
will guide your choice of contract type.

11

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

●

Requirements Type Task Orders: As discussed in the GSA Acquisition Letter (AL) MV21-06, Procurement of Cloud Computing on a Consumption Basis under the Federal
Supply Schedule (FSS) program, GSA proposed a requirements task order framework to
buy cloud on a consumption basis, and proposed facilitating incremental funding via
optional CLINs. (see Appendix A for General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR)
Clause 552.238.199 Special Ordering Procedures Applicable when Procuring Cloud
Computing on a Consumption Basis (MAR 2022) and an example in Appendix B). This
ask order type is appropriate when the authorized Ordering Activity anticipates recurring
requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities of cloud computing
services that designated government activities will need during a definite period.
NOTE: The special ordering procedures clause (GSAR Clause 552.238.199 Special
Ordering Procedures Applicable when Procuring Cloud Computing on a
Consumption Basis (MAR 2022)) is only required, per (c)(1), "when placing an
incrementally funded task order under this contract for cloud computing services
on a consumption basis." Otherwise, the clause is optional. Nothing in GSAR
552.238-199 shall be construed to supersede the Ordering Activity’s contrac
funding policies (GSAR 552.238-199(f)(3))
●

Consumption Framework
○ Ordering activities can do this today but current policies don’t provide a
roadmap for how to implement a consumption framework. Per GSA’s
Acquisition Letter (AL) MV-21-06 Supplement 1, dated March 18, 2022,
adding GSAR Clause 552.238-199 into the MAS Solicitation allows
Ordering Activities to use a “requirements type task order” contract type,
which is a “task order that provides for filling all actual purchase
requirements of a designated authorized Ordering Activity during a
specified contract period, with performance by the Contractor being
scheduled when the authorized Ordering Activity awards, or exercises
options for, individual contract line items (CLINs) under the task order.”
○

●

Well defined requirements lend themselves to the obligation of funding on
a contract upfront, while unpredictable requirements might best be funded
using optional CLINs that are funded at time of activation. But the core
benefits of cloud include on-demand self-service and rapid elasticity,
which supports agile development, DevOps, and unforeseen spikes in
demand. If your requirements aren’t well defined, consider establishing
predefined requirements on CLINs to be used later.

Incremental Funding
○

The Antideficiency Act requires that whenever an Ordering Activity enters
into a contractual obligation it must obligate funding sufficient to cover the
contractual obligation. While this is necessary to meet the legal
requirement, it can commit Ordering Activity funds in a manner that may
preclude any alternative use of those funds.
Note: Ordering activities incur obligations and make expenditures while
executing the funded programs, projects, and activities. An obligation is
any action that legally binds the Ordering Activity to make an outlay or
12

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

expenditure of funds immediately or in the future. Expenditures may not
exceed obligations, and corrective action must be taken promptly to
validate the expenditures and obligation if it appears that they have.
○

When your actual cloud expenditure for the fiscal year is forecasted to not
match the amount of funds obligated, you may need to obligate more
money or deobligate excess funds on the contract. Make sure to
coordinate such matters with your controller/financial organization (CFO)
and legal counsel.

○

The main elements of Acquisition Letter MV-21-06 provide a framework
for obligating funds “as you go” while providing safeguards to ensure you
do not violate the Antideficiency Act. This policy requires Ordering
Activities to obligate funding when optional CLINs are activated in
accordance with FAR 17.2. This is not as fluid as private sector practices
but it does provide a way for Ordering Activities not to obligate funds on
optional CLINs until there is a bona fide need and those CLINs are
activated.
Note: MAS BPAs have no ceiling value, only an estimate, so Ordering
Activities can have many options without having to worry about using a
ceiling like under an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ)/GWAC
(e.g., STARS 8(a)). The ceiling value is only on the Ordering Activities
awarded TO/PO. It is not easily increased (e.g., increase in scope), so the
ceiling value should be estimated appropriately.

○

●

Always consult your Ordering Activity’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and
legal counsel for guidance on the specific laws, regulations, and
authorities applicable to funding your order.

Fixed Price (FP) Model: This type of contract has the advantage of allowing changes to
he number or complexion of cloud services at the touch of a button, but may not have
he ability to reduce overall cost when not utilizing the cloud resource. If your agency has
he ability to leverage more than one contract type, a blended/optimized solution may be
possible. This blended model works best if an Ordering Activity has a good handle on
13

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

the baseline for cloud computing needs. A BPA might be used to combine FP, Time &
Material (T&M), and Requirements Type models since each Task Order (TO) issued
under a BPA can carry a different contract type.
●

Time & Materials (T&M) Model: Since cloud services often accrue charges by the
minute, hour, etc., charges will vary from invoice to invoice over the period of
performance. (That’s the “T” in T&M.) Since FAR 16.601 only references hourly rates,
agencies may need to define a method of calculating fractional hours if needed. This
closely resembles invoices for work done on a labor contract. This type of contract fits
most closely to the way charges for cloud services often accrue commercially. It is worth
noting that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) only discusses the T&M model
contract with respect to labor. So, agencies must rely on FAR 1.102(d), which essentially
says that if the FAR does not expressly forbid it, then it is permissible. Though it will be
up to the Ordering Activity’s CO to determine what they deem allowable for the agency.
There are certain requirements/limitations for T&M in accordance with FAR Part 12.07.
For example, the CO must prepare a determination and findings (D&F) that shall be
assigned and signed by the Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) or other official in
accordance with agency policy, and additional approval required for contracts expected
o extend beyond three years. Also, required with FAR 8.404(h)(3)(i)(B).

f. Authorized Reseller vs. CSP (direct)
Some CSPs sell directly while others prefer to sell via a network of authorized resellers. This
arrangement is readily compared to a car manufacturer/dealer relationship. While it can be
difficult to track down the cloud services you desire to an authorized reseller that sells it, there is
an advantage to this arrangement.
An IT customer may need access to more than one CSP for regulatory and/or technical
reasons. An award to an authorized reseller that offers multiple CSP catalogs may reduce the
number of acquisition actions needed. On the other hand, an award to a single CSP allows the
Ordering Activity a more direct relationship to the CSP without a third party, which may result in
he ability to obtain discounting as well as different customer support options.
The acquisition strategy will be driven by the Ordering Activity’s technical, performance, and
management requirements which may or may not lend itself to authorized resellers or CSPs.
The depth and breadth of the GSA MAS Solicitation provides the ability to meet varying needs.

g. Multi-Cloud Strategy for IaaS and PaaS?
An authorized Ordering Activity may decide to leverage cloud services (i.e. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
from multiple CSPs, which means they are operating in a multi-cloud environment using a multicloud strategy to meet their requirements.
When an authorized Ordering Activity uses a multi-cloud strategy they are then able to
determine which CSP's cloud services best satisfy their requirements (e.g., business,
operations, security, technical) and deploy their workloads accordingly. A multi-cloud strategy
may also allow Ordering Activities to take advantage of each CSP's evolving innovation and/or
specialized services (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence).

14

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

It is important to note that these benefits accrue to enterprises that deploy and leverage
he IaaS and PaaS of more than one CSP, not those that segregate their cloud business
by standardizing with a single IaaS and PaaS provider and then working with various
SaaS providers.
Ordering Activities could also consider employing a multi-cloud strategy, perhaps in conjunction
with a BPA. There are cloud authorized resellers who can provide access to multiple CSPs.
Requirements documents and solicitations can be structured to include access to multiple CSPs
hat meet a list of specified requirements. Solicitations can be designed to specify tha
authorized resellers must provide access to a particular CSP (as supported through the
appropriate Brand Name Justification or Limited Source Justification) as well as access to “X”
number of other CSPs whose cloud offerings meet a list of specified requirements as defined by
he Ordering Activity. This way the Ordering Activity is guaranteed access to the CSP(s) that are
currently hosting their architecture while allowing for the flexibility to access other CSPs that can
be leveraged moving forward.
Multi-cloud buffers the Ordering Activity from the risk of CSP lock-in, which may reduce the
fees/burden of an Ordering Activity when moving its data to a different CSP. Ordering Activities
hat cannot cost-justify or afford to take their cloud business from their current CSP to a
competitor effectively forfeit negotiating leverage. An Ordering Activity might choose to make it a
requirement of the contract that the Authorized Contractor shall cooperate with other Authorized
Contractors and government staff when transitioning between CSPs.

h. Cloud Computing as a Set Aside?
Cloud computing services are frequently sold by small business authorized resellers of
large CSP businesses’ cloud offerings. So you might think this is a good case for a small
business set aside.
However, the Small Business Administration (SBA) considers cloud computing as a
service and not a product per CFR 121.1203(d)(3). Therefore the non-manufacturing
rule (NMR) does not apply since the NMR only applies to products. Often the authorized
reseller is a small business and the CSP is a large business, and more than 50% of the
funding goes to the CSP, therefore no small business credit is given.
The bottom line is that a set aside for cloud computing will usually be indefensible. One
exception is if the CSP itself is a small business (which is not common). Another
exception is if the authorized reseller is a small business and the CSP is a large
business and the “primary purpose” of the acquisition is not for cloud computing (which
is not likely).
Keep in mind that cloud computing is excluded from the limitations on subcontracting
calculation where the small business concern will perform other cloud professional
services that are the primary purpose of the acquisition, in accordance with 13 CFR
125.6(a)(1).

i. FedRAMP
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a governmentwide
program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government by

15

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

providing a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous
monitoring for cloud products and services.
FedRAMP eliminates duplicative efforts by providing a common security framework. Agencies
review their security requirements against a standardized baseline. A CSP goes through the
authorization process once, and after achieving an authorization for their Cloud Service Offering
(CSO), the security package can be reused by any federal agency.
When thinking about FedRAMP, it is best to look at it from two different perspectives: acquisition
versus security.
●

Acquisition
○ To accomplish the goals of the Competition in Contracting Act (10 USC
§2304(a)(1), FedRAMP recommends against making a FedRAMP authorization
a requirement for any cloud services procurement because it unfairly limits
competition.
○

●

The recommendation is to only require respondents to state what their FedRAMP
status is, and to score possession of a FedRAMP authorization appropriately
during the evaluation of responses. Ultimately, the authorized Ordering Activity
CO will make the decision on FedRAMP being a requirement.

Security
Once the Ordering Activity is in post award status, per the rules of the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA), each Ordering Activity CIO will still need
o conduct their Assessment and Analysis (A&A) and issue an all encompassing
Authority to Operate (ATO) for the CSO to go into production by using NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-53 rev. 5 Risk Management Framework (RMF), which is wha
FedRAMP uses per their Policy Memo. This ATO process should be more streamlined
for success if the CSO already has a FedRAMP authorization.

Obtaining a FedRAMP Authorization:
There are two approaches for a CSP to obtain a FedRAMP Authorization (if one does no
already exist), a provisional authorization through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) or an
authorization through an agency.
1. In the Agency Authorization path, agencies may work directly with a CSP for
authorization at any time. CSPs that make a business decision to work directly with an
agency to pursue an ATO will work with the agency throughout the FedRAMP
Authorization process.
2. In the JAB Authorization path, the JAB is the primary governing body for FedRAMP and
includes the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
and GSA. The JAB selects approximately 12 cloud products a year to work with for a
JAB Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO). Additionally, the JAB is responsible for
performing the continuous monitoring for all JAB Authorized cloud products.

16

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

j. Term Services and Period of Performance (PoP) Alignment
Ordering Activities can procure multi-year “cloud reservations” as long as the multi-year
reservation falls within a single PoP.
The execution of any cloud service (1 year reservation, 3 year reservation*) can not commit the
Ordering Activity to incur costs beyond a CO awarded PoP.
●

Example A: An Ordering Activity could not purchase a 3 year reservation under a 1 year
PoP (e.g. base year, option year); the 3 year reservation extends beyond the PoP and
would make the Ordering Activity incur costs outside of the executed PoP. They also can
not execute the Base Year, Option Year 1, and Option Year 2 PoPs at the same time as
only one PoP can be executed at a time.

●

Example B: If using the Multi-Year Contracting special contracting method under FAR
17.1 an Ordering Activity could potentially award a 5 year PoP in accordance with the
requirements set forth at FAR 17.1. A 3 year reservation could be executed anytime in
he 1st and 2nd year, but once the contract was 2 years and 1 day into the PoP the
Ordering Activity would not be able to execute a 3 year reservation since the reservation
period would extend beyond the end of the PoP. Please note that Contracting Officers
will need to work with the finance organization, OCAO, and legal counsel before using
Multi-Year Contracting and reservations greater than one year.

From the examples above, you can see that procuring cloud services on SIN 518210C does not
function the same as procuring perpetual software products from SIN 511210 Software
Licenses.
●
●

With SIN 518210C Cloud Computing and Cloud Related IT Professional Services, the
limitation is the PoP start/end dates; the cloud service stops on the PoP end date.
With SIN 511210 Software Licenses, the only concern is the incurred cost must happen
before the PoP end date, since the software product can be used after the end date.

The primary issues revolve around who in the Ordering Activity has the authority to commit the
Ordering Activity to incur costs, which is the authority of a CO. The decision to execute an
option also resides entirely with the CO.
* 3 year “cloud reservations” can be purchased with different types of appropriations (e.g., single
year, multi-year, no year funds) per (10 U.S.C. 2306c - Armed Forces - Multiyear Contracts:
Acquisition of Services and 41 U.S.C. 3903 - Public Contracts - Multiyear Contracts )

3. Governance
Without proper cloud governance in place, many funding, contracting, and general
communication failures are likely. Without such governance/controls in place, your Ordering
Activity could suffer runaway cloud expenses.
In preparation for a cloud award, your Ordering Activity must be able to answer questions such
as:
1. Who in the Ordering Activity will monitor the burn rate of the funding and be in charge of alerting
others of issues of funding shortfall and/or overages?
2. Who will be the cloud finance point of contact that can reconcile cloud usage with a cloud
invoice and review cloud utilization reports for chargeback purposes? Will it be the COR or
someone else?
3. Who will have the task of provisioning new cloud services under a Task Order? Who will have
he authority to delegate that task?
4. Who will be in charge of ensuring/authorizing the spinning down of cloud services when they are
not in use?
5. Who will be responsible for monitoring security and compliance of the cloud services?

19

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

The Ordering Activity might find that it needs to add a requirement for contractor labor to accomplish
he above tasks. Even when contractor labor is not included in the solicitation, Ordering Activities mus
make it clear in their requirements that the CSP or authorized reseller must do nothing that restricts
direct access to all tools, data, and capabilities that it requires for governance.
For an in depth review of governance, look at Section 8 of Federal Cloud Strategy Guide and the
governance resources on the Cloud Information Center.
GSA recommends coordinating with your CFO, OCAO, and legal counsel.

4. Fund the Acquisition
The proper funding of cloud computing contracts has been an obstacle to cloud services acquisition. As
industry has innovated new ways to charge for cloud services on a consumption basis, federal
procurement regulations have not kept pace. Cloud computing charges often accrue on a charge per
use basis. Contracting Officers will need to work with the finance organization, OCAO, and legal
counsel to determine what is the best “color of money” to use when funding a cloud contract for your
Ordering Activity.
Some points you may consider in your discussions:
●

Funds will be obligated via Task Orders issued by an Ordering Contracting Officer for
authorized Ordering Activities, in accordance with the ordering activity’s specific rules,
regulations, policies and procedures.
The Ordering Activity Ordering Contracting Officer shall engage the Ordering Activity Financial
Management Office and Program Management Office to ensure adequate and proper funds are
available for Task Order placement.

●

Capital Expenditure (CapEx) funds: (e.g., investment, procurement, or research and
development funds) may sometimes be used to acquire and upgrade on premises (non-cloud)
computer hardware and software for the longer term. Ordering activities must not circumven
appropriations regulations and use funds approved for CapEx to procure cloud services. Work
with the finance organization, OCAO and legal counsel to determine if CapEx can be used and
how far in advance they can be budgeted.

●

Operations Expenditure (OpEx) funds: (e.g., operations and maintenance or operations and
sustainment funds) are used for more predictable, shorter term expenses. OpEx funds may be
ideal for cloud, due to the month to month nature of cloud expenses. This is a natural transition
from CapEx funding models as Ordering Activities decommission their data centers and begin
using a cloud funding model with OpEx funds.

Congress annually distributes the year’s budgetary funds to appropriated Ordering Activities which are
generally tied to one fiscal year. It is best practice to consult your Ordering Activities CFO, legal
counsel, fiscal law experts, and contracting officer(s) to understand using no-year, multi-year, or 1 year
funds and check (10 U.S.C 2306a and 41 U.S.C 3903) citations that might allow 1 year funds to fund
multi-year FAR 17.1 contracts. Cloud services aren’t a one and done expense; rather something to
refine, optimize, spin up and down, and leverage as you build out more of your cloud environment.
Flexible working capital funds that span years have been found to work best, if your Ordering Activity
has access to them.

20

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

5. Issue a Solicitation
When market research and acquisition planning steps have been completed, and funding is secured, i
is time to develop and publish a cloud solicitation. When the government wants to buy a good or
service, it issues a solicitation. Solicitations are documents that make the government's requirements
clear so that businesses can submit competitive bids.

a. eBuy:
In accordance with FAR 8.405-2, Ordering Activities may use GSA’s electronic RFQ system, called
eBuy (the only electronic way to publish a solicitation against SIN 518210C) at no cost. Posting the
RFQ on e-Buy allows all schedule contractors offering SIN 518210C an opportunity to submit a quote.
GSA’s eBuy tool facilitates the process, all while keeping Ordering Activities FAR compliant.
*Note that use of eBuy is not required in all circumstances and if ordering above the Simplified
Acquisition Threshold (SAT), Ordering Activities need only “reasonably ensure that quotes will be
received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements” (see FAR 8.405-2(c)(3)(iii)(B)).
●
●
●

Log onto ebuy.gsa.gov
Select the contractors and/or GSA MAS SINs who your Ordering Activity want to receive the
solicitation
Release the solicitation to your selected contractors

Ordering activities can get assistance with eBuy via the Ordering Activity’s GSA National Account
Manager (NAM), Customer Service Director (CSD) or their respective GSA MAS Contracting Officer
(CO). If you need help getting connected with a GSA NAM/CSD or GSA MAS CO, email the GSA
Cloud Team at cloudinfo@gsa.gov.

b. SAM.gov:
The System for Award Management, or SAM, is a government-wide portal that consolidates the
capabilities of multiple systems and information sources used by the Federal government in conducting
he acquisition and financial assistance. Anyone interested in doing business with the government can
use this system to search opportunities. Opportunities include pre-solicitation notices, solicitation
notices, award notices, and sole source notices.

6. Evaluation of Responses
There are multiple technical metrics to consider when evaluating the different cloud service offerings
submitted in offeror/contractor quotes: performance, security, and agility, to name a few. Proposed
individual cloud UPCs are difficult to compare on a one-to-one basis. Thus, many Ordering Activities
have used the best value method to trade off one metric for another. By providing a selection, Ordering
Activities are afforded the opportunity to fulfill their requirements with the offerings that constitute the
best value and that meet their needs at the lowest overall cost.
Example metrics to consider for IaaS/PaaS cloud service offerings:

services
○ Measured Services that allow for pay-as-you-go, pay-per-use, or charge-per-use
for services.

It is important to note, the evaluation process MUST align with the technical evaluation factors specified
in the solicitation.

7. Make an Award
GSA’s Acquisition Letter (AL) MV-21-06, Procurement of Cloud Computing on a Consumption
Basis under the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program and Supplement 1, dated March 18,
2022, establishes special ordering procedures for the procurement of cloud computing on a
consumption basis for the Federal Supply Schedule program. As a result of this AL, GSAR
Clause 552.238-199 Special Ordering Procedures Applicable when Procuring Cloud
Computing on a Consumption Basis (MAR 2022) should be included in the awarded
BPA/Task Order (See Appendix A). This will add a requirement that will give the authorized
Ordering Activity access to commercial sale pricelist tools to help in accomplishing the above

Appendix A: GSAR Clause 552.238-199
[GSAR Clause 552.238-199 Special Ordering Procedures Applicable when Procuring
Cloud Computing on a Consumption Basis
As directed by Acquisition Letter MV-21-06, GSA FSS Contracting Officers shall insert the
following clause in contracts offering cloud computing services on a consumption basis under
Special Item Number (SIN) 518210C (previously 132-40) or successor SINs within the
Information Technology (IT) Category (previously Schedule 70):
## SPECIAL ORDERING PROCEDURES APPLICABLE WHEN PROCURING CLOUD
COMPUTING ON A CONSUMPTION BASIS (MAR 2022)

Standards and Technology in Special Publication (SP) 800–145 and any amendatory or
superseding document(s) thereto.
(3) “Consumption basis” or “consumption-based” means any offering tha
is metered with charges that accrue on a predetermined periodic basis (e.g., per
second, minute, hour, week, month, or another per-unit basis) and is billed based
on actual usage during an elapsed period with predetermined pricing or
discounts.
(4) “Requirements task order” means a task order that provides for filling
all actual purchase requirements of a designated Ordering Activity during a
specified contract period, with performance by the contractor being scheduled
when the Ordering Activity awards, or exercises options for, individual contrac
line items (CLINs) under the task order.
(i) This task order type is appropriate when the Ordering Activity
anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise
quantities of services that it will need during a definite period.
(ii) A requirements task order issued under a FSS contract is a single
contract award as defined FAR 2.101. Individual CLINs executed and funded
under this task order type are not considered to be second-tier instruments
issued under the awarded task order.
(iii) A requirements task order is not a requirements contract as
described at FAR 16.503.
(b) Ordering procedures.

23

ceiling price for all estimated requirements.
(2) All cloud computing services offered under this FSS contract are
considered fixed-price.
(e) Task order type. The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer shall use a
requirements task order for cloud computing services procured on a
consumption basis in accordance with this clause.
(1) This task order type may include other contract types, such as
firm-fixed-price, when procuring other offerings under this contract that are no
being procured on a consumption-basis.
(2) Estimates for cloud computing services to be procured on a
consumption basis.
(i) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must state a realistic
estimate of—
(A) The consumption of cloud computing services in the task order
solicitation; and
(B) The total amount in dollars to be expended on cloud
consumption in the task order.
(ii) This estimate is not a representation to an Offeror or Contractor tha
24

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

the estimated consumption will be required or ordered, or that conditions
affecting requirements will be stable or normal.
(iii) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer may obtain the estimate
from records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means, and
should base the estimate on the most current information available.
(iv) If the Government’s requirements do not meet this estimate, that fact shall
not constitute the basis for an equitable price adjustment.
(3) All CLINs within the task order must include a defined scope with all
services priced at the time of award.
(f) Incremental funding.
(1) The Ordering Activity may allot funds incrementally as the bona fide
need arises for predefined and established fixed-priced procuremen
requirements on individual CLINs.

ask order—
(i) At the time of award to cover the total amount payable to the
Contractor for the awarded CLIN(s); and
(ii) At the time an optional CLIN is exercised to cover the total amoun
payable to the Contractor for that optional CLIN.
(3) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to supersede the Ordering
Activity’s contract funding policies.
(g) Consumption monitoring.
(1) The Contractor shall—
(i) Provide, at no additional cost to the Government, access to tools tha
enable the Government to track its usage of cloud computing services offered on
a consumption basis; or
(ii) Notify the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer when total
consumption reaches—
(A) 50 percent and 75 percent of the ceiling price for each CLIN for
consumption-based cloud computing services, or other milestones as
agreed
upon by the Contractor and the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer; and
(B) 50 percent and 75 percent of the task order ceiling price, or other
milestones as agreed upon by the Contractor and the Ordering Activity
Contracting Officer.

25

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

monitoring capabilities offered by the Contractor will enable the Government to
adequately track its incurred costs before awarding a task order in accordance with this
clause.
(h) Limitation of funds.
(1) The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amoun
in excess of the ceiling price in the task order, and the Contractor shall not be
obligated to continue performance if doing so would exceed the ceiling price se
forth in the task order.
(2) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer may use a Limitation of Funds
clause when CLINs under the task order are incrementally funded.
(i) Scope reviews.
(1) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer is encouraged to request a
scope review from the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of
Information Technology Category (ITC) before placing a task order in accordance
with these special ordering procedures.
(2) The purpose of a scope review is to analyze whether the planned
acquisition is—
(i) compatible with the scope of Special Item Number (SIN) 518210C
(previously 132-40) or successor SINs;
(ii) utilizing recommended best practices; and
(iii) not for the acquisition, maintenance, or modification of capital
Assets.
(3) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer may request a scope review by contacting
FAS ITC at cloud-sin-rfi@gsa.gov.

Appendix B: Examples of Consumption Based
Ordering
CSP cloud service catalogs are changing quickly and constantly and many Ordering Activities
want to take advantage of any new emerging technology as soon as it is available. An Ordering
Activity may need an authorized contractor to have the new service(s) added to their GSA MAS
Service Catalog if they aren’t listed as an awarded CLIN. For currently awarded TO’s, the CO
will need to negotiate with the authorized contractor before modifying the TO to add the new
services and pricing.
Below are examples of the implementation of a CLIN structure for the acquisition of cloud
compute (i.e., IaaS) services based on the addition of GSAR Clause 552.238-199 Special
Ordering Procedures Applicable when Procuring Cloud Computing on a Consumption Basis into
he MAS Solicitation. The examples and analysis are not exhaustive and are meant to give an
Ordering Activity only the guidance of what’s possible.
1. Fixed Price Non-Term Cloud Computing Services (e.g., On-Demand)
○

Awarded CLINs:
■ have a defined scope (e.g., functional, technical) and are fully funded a
ime of award with funded values being the ceiling value of the CLIN.
■

Examples below in Figures 1-3: (CLINs 1000, 2000)

■

Sub-CLINs - Under the Awarded CLINs there are Sub-CLINs with
explicitly defined scope (i.e., explicit compute type) that falls within the
scope of the Awarded CLIN.

■

The Sub-CLINs are not individually funded at time of award, all funding
remains obligated at the Awarded CLIN level.

■

The Sub-CLINs with the explicitly defined scope lists the specific compute
service (i.e., “cloud reservation” type) with negotiated and awarded uni
cost and the unit of measure. The quantity is left empty at time of award.

■

As the Ordering Activity uses the listed Sub-CLINs compute services the
Ordering Activity is invoiced in arrears on a monthly basis. The invoice
lists the quantity of services used for each Sub-CLIN and provides an
incurred cost for each explicit service. The total incurred costs for all SubCLINs is then subtracted from the Award CLIN resulting in the balance of
funding (i.e., remaining funding on the CLIN).

■

Under this model the Ordering Activity has documented what cloud
services have been awarded (i.e., on contract) and the awarded price per
listed unit of measure for that service (i.e., Fixed Price). This then allows
consumed (i.e., used) services to be traceable at time of invoice. The
Ordering Activity’s usage is cumulative month to month and each invoice

27

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

will list the cumulative usage (i.e., quantity) for each Sub-CLIN.
○

Optional CLINs - Not funded at time of award. The OACO has to execute a
contract modification to execute and fully fund the Optional CLIN.
■

Optional CLINs allow the OACO to incrementally fund services by
executing and fully funding each optional CLIN as funds are expensed.
This limits the risk that a significant amount of funding will remain on the
contract at the end of a period of performance and require de-obligation
contacting actions where the de-obligated funding may not be available
for re-obligation to another CLIN or contract (e.g., 1 Year funds).

■

Examples below in Figures 1-3: (CLIN 2100)

■

Sub-CLINs - The same logic for an awarded CLINs Sub-CLIN above
applies here.

■

In the example below the OCO executes the optional CLIN sometime in
October when the OACO is notified that CLIN 2000 is 50% or 75%
expended (i.e., costs incurred).

■

When the OACO executes the optional CLIN 2100, that is a duplication of
CLIN 2000, there is no disruption in services when CLIN 2000 is fully
expended. The ongoing incurred costs simply transition to CLIN 2100
without interruption.

Example A: Non-Term (On-Demand) Cloud Compute
In Figures 1-3 below, there are 3 monthly invoices for 2 awarded CLINs and 1 optional
CLIN. The yellow filled cells in Figure 2 indicate quantity changes between the
September and October invoices (i.e., October usage), and the orange fill in Figure 3
indicate the quantity changes between October and November (i.e., November usage).
From September to November the awarded CLINs balances decreased to indicate the
Ordering Activities continued usage of services.

unfunded).

2. Fixed Price (FP) - Term Cloud Computing Services (e.g., “cloud reservations”)
○

Awarded CLINs - Under the (FP) Term Cloud Computing Services (e.g., “cloud
reservations”) there are only Awarded CLINs.

○

Optional CLINs - Not permitted.

Cloud reservations - are defined by 3 parameters: Service, Cost, and Term Period. The
Ordering Activity is locked into a set cost for a defined service regardless of whether or
not the Ordering Activity uses the service.
As a result, only an OCO can execute/activate these services since only a warranted
Contracting Officer can enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts within the limits
of their authority.
Example B: Term (“cloud reservations”) Cloud Compute (IaaS)
CLINs are fully funded at time of execution and should be invoiced monthly or in
accordance with the payment terms for the cloud reservations.

30

Guidance & Not Legal Authority

In this example the contract was awarded in September making August the 12 months.
For CLINs 4000 - 4004 the 1 year Term Cloud Computing Services have been fully
expended and the balance is $0.00.
FFP CLINs should be used for Ordering Activity baseline (e.g., steady state) cloud
services in order to maximize cost savings.

* Allowable only under Multiple Year Contracts (FAR 17.1) where the Period of Perfromance (PoP) is 3
years or longer.

Other Notes when dealing with CLINs and Authorized Contractors:
●

“Broad” all encompassing CLINs - In regard to Line Items, FAR 8-404(j) "Line Items''
states, “When placing orders or establishing BPAs, ordering activities shall reference the
special item number and the corresponding line or subline item awarded (established
per 4.1005) in the schedule.” So, the FAR requires that the Line Item on the Ordering
Activity’s Task/Purchase Order references the line or subline on the Contractor’s GSA
Schedule Pricelist. Unless the GSA Schedule Pricelist has awarded a specific line-item
price for a “catalog of available cloud services”,i.e.., "Broad CLIN", the Ordering Activity
may not be able to award an Order for a “Broad CLIN.” The Order would need to list the
specific CLINs awarded by the Ordering Activity that map to specific items listed on the
awarded GSA Schedule Pricelist.

●

“Cloud Marketplaces” - This is a selection of offerings that may support the workload and
cloud requirements of an Ordering Activity. If using, the Ordering Activity needs to
ensure the Line Item they are enabling from the marketplace is in the original
requirements. Just because you have the ability to go to a CSP and “turn on” new
financial management or HR type software with just a click, doesn’t mean it is within
scope of your original stated contract requirements.
