OLM Authority

OLM Special Item Number (SIN)

Order-Level Materials (OLMs) are supplies and/or services acquired in direct support of an individual
ask or delivery order placed against a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract or FSS blanke
purchase agreement (BPA). OLMs are not defined, priced, or awarded at the FSS contract level.
They are unknown before a task or delivery order is placed against the FSS contract or FSS BPA.
OLMs are only authorized for inclusion at the order level under a Time-and-Materials (T&M) or
Labor Hour (LH) Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) and are subject to a Not To Exceed (NTE) ceiling
price. OLMs include direct materials, subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which
here is not a labor category specified in the FSS contract, other direct costs (separate from those
under ODC SINs), and indirect costs. OLMs are purchased under the authority of the FSS Program
and are not “open market items.”
Items awarded under ancillary supplies/services or other direct cost (ODC) SINs are not OLMs.
These items are defined, priced, and awarded at the FSS contract level, whereas OLMs are
unknown before an order is placed. Ancillary supplies/services and ODC SINs are for use under all
order type CLINs (Fixed-Price (FP), T&M, and LH), whereas the Order-Level Materials SIN is only
authorized for use under T&M and LH order CLINs.
The Order-Level Materials SIN is only authorized for use in direct support of another awarded SIN.
Price analysis for OLMs is not conducted when awarding the FSS contract or FSS BPA; therefore,
GSAR 538.270 and 538.271 do not apply to OLMs. OLMs are defined and priced at the ordering
activity level in accordance with GSAR clause 552.238-115 Special Ordering Procedures for the
Acquisition of Order-Level Materials. Prices for items provided under the Order-Level Materials SIN
must be inclusive of the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF).
The value of OLMs in a task or delivery order, or the cumulative value of OLMs in orders against an
FSS BPA awarded under an FSS contract, cannot exceed 33.33%.

Describing Agency Needs and Alternatives to Brand-Name
Constraints

1. Brand Name or Equal

‘... the use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions may be
advantageous under certain circumstances” and ‘... (b)rand name or equal purchase descriptions
must include, in addition to the brand name, a general description of those salient physical,
functional, or performance characteristics of the brand name item that an ‘equal’ item mus
meet to be acceptable for award. Use brand name or equal descriptions when the salien
characteristics are firm requirements.”
2. Brand Name

“agency requirements shall not be written so as to require a particular
brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer, thereby precluding
consideration of a product manufactured by another company, unless ... (t)he particular brand
name, product, or feature is essential to the government’s requirements, and market research
indicates other companies’ similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do no
meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency’s needs.”

Section 3: Ordering Procedures

Statement of Work (SOW) and Request for Quotation (RFQ)
Generally, ordering activities use these procedures when ordering services priced a
hourly rates as established by Schedule contracts. The applicable services will be identified in
he GSA Schedules and the contractor’s price list.

Use of Oral Presentations
Oral presentations are not typically used under a GSA Schedules procuremen
environment but may be used at the discretion of the ordering activity’s Contracting Officer.
It is important that the ordering activity’s Contracting Officer use proper procedures and no
mix FAR Part 15 ordering procedures with FAR Subpart 8.4 procedures for placing orders
against GSA Schedules. However, the ordering activity’s Contracting Officer may consult FAR
15.102 for processes and techniques for the use of oral presentations and tailor them to fit the
requirements in FAR Subpart 8.4. These procedures are outlined on the following page.

Obligation of Funds

This BPA does not obligate funds. The government is obligated only to the extent of authorized
orders actually issued against the BPA. The government estimates, but does not guarantee, that the
volume of purchases through these agreements will be (estimated value) over the life of these BPAs.
This is not a ceiling amount and the accumulated value of task orders issued under these BPAs may
exceed this amount without modification to the BPA.
