Rating Guidelines

Quality of Product or Service
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding
Unsatisfactory Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources.
Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in
consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.
Poor

Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

Fair

Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

Good

There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.

Excellent

There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements
without commensurate additional costs to the Government.

Outstanding

The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated
achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is
expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the
performance levels described as "Excellent".

Timeliness of Performance
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding
Unsatisfactory Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is no
likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for
future awards.
Poor

Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

Fair

Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

Good

There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.

Excellent

There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.

Outstanding

The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is
expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the
performance levels described as "Excellent".

Responsiveness
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding
Unsatisfactory Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or
corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.
Poor

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.

Fair

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.

Good

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.

Excellent

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.

Outstanding

The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is
expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the
performance levels described as "Excellent".

Cost Control
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding
Unsatisfactory Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources.
Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues
constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.
Poor

Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

Fair

Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

Good

There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.

Excellent

There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost
savings to the Government.

Outstanding

The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is
expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and
performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".
