Evaluation Criteria

THE EVALUATION CRITERIA SHOULD BE TAILORED TO MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. IT MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE
EVALUATION CRITERIA IN THE ACQUISITION PLAN AND THE EVALUATION PLAN!!!

a. Implementation of Past Performance:
(a) FAPIIS- This system is intended to significantly enhance the scope of information available to Contracting Officers as they
evaluate the integrity and performance of prospective awardees. The FAPIIS information is available to Contracting Officers for
viewing by accessing the Past Performance Information Retrieval System or PPIRS. Contracting officials can input applicable
information into the FAPIIS module of the Contractor Performance Assessment Review System or CPARS.
(b) The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by
he offeror. This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance.
(c) The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure the problems it finds in the information provided by the
Offeror. The burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information remains with the Offeror.

•

If past performance is not an evaluation factor for this procurement, the CO will still review the Federal
Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and the Excluded Parties Lists System (EPLS)
information on the awardee in order to make a responsibility determination in accordance with FAR 9.104-6
FAPIIS and FAR 9.105-1 Obtaining Information.

[AGENCY] will evaluate all quotes to determine the best value to the government. [AGENCY] will make that determination based on
each vendor’s quote using the following evaluation criteria, listed in their descending order of importance:

•

Past Performance (PP) demonstrates relevant experience or performance on how well contractors manage and comply with
contractual requirements in the past. (Per needs of client’s requirements and/or Open Market, or Sole Source Procurement)
PP evaluation will take into account (a) the currency and relevance of an offeror’s PP; (b) the source of the information; (c)
he context of the data; and (d) the quality of an offeror’s PP.

Project Number: TASK ORDER ID
Client Name: CLIENT NAME

SOW/PWS
## DATE

•

Past Experience (PE) and its relevancy to the scope, size, and duration of requirements identified in the PWS within the last 3
years (tailor to your requirement and make sure this matches your Evaluation Plan).

•

Technical Approach (TA) and its feasibility, practicability and appropriateness in accomplishing PWS requirements.

•

Price: Evaluated to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.

PP/PE/TA is more/significantly more important than PP/PE/TA. PP/PE/TA is more/significantly more important than PP/PE/TA. Nonprice factors, when combined, are less/more/significantly more/less important than/ equal to Price. As the difference in non-price
factors becomes closer, Price may become more important. Non-price factors will be evaluated first, then price. (Tailor to your
requirement)
The following definitions will be used with respect to the above criteria:
•

•

PE
•

Past Experience: Work the vendor has performed that shows they have the capability to successfully complete the tasks
identified in this solicitation at minimum risk to the Government.

•

Scope: The range of work/skills being referenced is similar in nature to the requirements identified in the PWS.

TA:
•

Technical Approach: Description of the vendor’s knowledge and understanding of the requirements as outlined in the
PWS. Includes the methodologies, processes, and techniques used to successfully complete the PWS requirements.

•

Feasible: Can successfully accomplish the tasks with the identified resources.

•

Practical: Logical approach that does not introduce a high level of risk in order to successfully complete the task
requirements.

•

Appropriate: A suitable approach that is within the scope of the task and satisfies all the task requirements (right tool for
he job).

Non-price factors (PP/PE/TA) when combined are significantly more important than price. As differences in non-price factor become
less significant, price will become increasingly more important. Non-price factors will be evaluated first, then price.
This requirement will be conducted in accordance with FAR 8.4 as the task order will be placed against a Federal Supply Schedule
contract. As such, debriefing as described in FAR 15.506 is NOT applicable in this instance. Vendor(s) are put on notice that only a

brief explanation of the basis for the award decision shall be provided as prescribed by FAR 8.405-2(d), and only if requested in
writing.
If any of the evaluation factors (PE/TA/PP) receives a rating of less than acceptable, the Quote will not be reviewed any further and
will not be considered for award.

Past Experience (PE)

This factor considers the extent of the offeror’s past experience in carrying out similar work. The government must have confidence
in the offeror's ability to complete a project with similar scope, size, and duration with minimal risk.

•

SIMILAR IN SCOPE IS DEFINED AS A MEASURABLE RANGE OF OPERATIONS SUCH AS THE
MAJOR REQUIREMENT AREAS OF A PWS. LIST THE CRITICAL AREAS FROM REQUIREMENT
THAT THEY MUST HAVE.

•

SIMILAR IN SIZE IS DEFINED AS DOLLAR VALUE, NUMBER OF PERSONNEL IN SIMILAR SKILL

•

A table cross-referencing the labor categories identified in this quote to the vendor’s proposed labor categories (based on the
vendor’s [SCHEDULE NAME] with a description of specific duties each will perform.

Past Performance:
The CO will evaluate the offeror’s PP as a measure of the Government’s confidence in the offeror’s ability to perform successfully,
his project based on demonstrated performance. The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the
quality of the offeror’s PP and any proposed subcontractor, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the
required effort. When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the PP of the offeror and its proposed
subcontractors as it relates to all solicitation requirements. The evaluation may include a review of your compliance with
subcontracting plan goals, monetary targets for small disadvantaged business (SDB) participation and notifications submitted under
19.1202-4(b). In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance
is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably but will receive a rating of “neutral”.

Required PP Information
PP will be evaluated based on the offeror’s relevant performance compared to the requirements specified in the solicitation/PWS. In
conducting the performance risk evaluation, the Government may use data provided by the offeror, data obtained from the
contractor’s PE references, and data obtained from other sources (FAPIIS/PPIRS/CPARS) that it considers current, accurate and
relevant.
Contractor Teaming Arrangements (CTA): If a CTA or prime-subcontractor arrangement is proposed, the vendor must provide a
breakout of the percentage of work performed by the prime and each subcontractor. The PP of each Team member (or critical
subcontractor) will be evaluated individually and then factored together for an overall Team factor rating (taking into consideration
he appropriate weight to give each Team member (or subcontractor) based on their planned performance as identified in the
quote. For example, if the offeror’s quote generally indicates to the Government that Team member “A” will perform a significan
amount of work, then commensurate weight (significant weight in this example) is given to Team member A’s experience rating in
assigning the overall Team experience rating.

Note: In rating this factor, the Government will evaluate the firm’s PP. The government’s consideration of PP will include the
offeror’s organizational PP but will not include specific consideration of the offeror’s proposed, current, or former contractor
personnel performance as part of the offeror’s organizational PP.

PP Evaluation Standard
In evaluating PP, the Government will review how well the offeror has performed on other relevant comparable projects with
respect to scope. In making this determination, the Government will review the following elements:
•
•
•
•
•

Management Controls: Responsiveness, staffing, project management
Quality of Services: Compliance with contract requirements, technical excellence, accuracy of reports
Customer Satisfaction: Reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer service
Schedule Compliance: Timeliness compared to the schedule of activities, milestones, and/or deliverables
Cost Control: Management of the contract/task budget and cost control

The Government may obtain data on PP through the FAPIIS/PPIRS/CPARS systems; any other database; by contacting references on
listed PE projects and/or by any other means.

Required PP Information
One of two options can be utilized:
•

Past Performance Questionnaire Form (Questionnaire mirrors the CPARS Form)

•

CO directly calling the PP references

Price
Price will be evaluated to determine the fairness and reasonableness of proposed pricing. Price will be evaluated separate from all
non-price elements of the quote. A rating will not be assigned to the evaluation of price.

This requirement is incrementally funded T&M/fully funded FFP with pricing based on GSA’s IT Schedule 70. In the pricing section

In an effort to receive the highest quality solution at the lowest possible price the government requests all available discounts on
all services offered by the contractor for this requirement. The contractor is encouraged to offer discounts below contract rates.
When offering discounts, quotes must clearly identify both the contract and the discount price for each discounted labor rate.
The vendor will provide prompt payment terms in their quote.

1.3 Other Direct Costs (ODCs)
An offeror’s quote should clearly reflect any items NOT covered by the vendor’s GSA schedule contract or a teaming arrangemen
with another schedule contractor. [AGENCY] must purchase any item exceeding $3000 not covered by a contractor’s schedule or
heir team member’s schedule.
The price quote shall include pricing for any ODCs other than travel if any are known. The contractor shall state in their quote if
here are no known ODCs. If G&A is included, the contractor must provide documentation that it was authorized in their GSA IT
Schedule 70 contract award.
Any quote that contains indirect costs such as General and Administrative (G&A) and Material and Handling (M&H) must comply
with the following:
General and Administrative (G&A) and Material and Handling (M&H) costs will not be allowed unless it’s an approved rate on the
offeror’s GSA schedule contract. If requested, the offeror must provide verification in the form of an approved GSA pricelist, showing
he approved G&A or M&H rate.
The offeror’s quotation will not be considered for award if G&A and/or M&H rates are quoted and the rates are not approved on the
offeror’s GSA schedule contract.

1.3.1 ODC Teaming
To provide for possible ODC purchases under this task order, the Government is asking for CTA(s) with other Schedule contractor(s).
At this time, all items possibly required under this task order are unknown. For items identified during the period of performance for
his task where the teaming arrangements already established cannot provide the items, it is the responsibility of the ‘prime’
contractor of this task order to form the necessary teaming arrangements to obtain those items.

The prime contractor of this task order shall submit all teaming arrangements established prior to quote submission for review by
he government. Provide any teaming arrangements established during the performance of the task order to the Contracting Officer
Project Number: TASK ORDER ID

## SCHEDULE

B8

TITLE
SOW/PWS
## DATE

for their files within 15 days after the establishment of the agreement. The contracting officer will modify the task order to include
he teaming arrangement(s).
Any Contractor Teaming Arrangements established under this task order shall designate all team members, their corresponding GSA
Schedule contract numbers and describe the tasks performed by each team member, along with associated proposed prices (e.g.,
unit prices, labor categories and rates).
The team lead responsibilities for any established teaming arrangements remain with the ‘prime’ contractor/awardee under this
ask order. The team lead is ultimately responsible for insuring performance of this task. However, each team member is
accountable under the terms and conditions of its contract for any problems identified.
When employing a CTA with another GSA Schedule holder, the ‘prime’ contractor or lead teaming partner must submit a ‘reques
for purchase’ preferably by email, to the Contracting Officer to get approval on each purchase made for Other Direct Costs (ODC’s)
such as equipment, software, etc. (does not include travel) utilizing teaming arrangements.
As a part of that email request, the contractor will submit the proposed purchase price for each item along with the teaming
partner’s name and Schedule contract number. Then also provide two other Schedule contract price comparisons for all of the
purchased items.
If there are no other Schedule contractors that provide the items off their Schedule contracts, then the ‘prime’ contractor should
provide other vendor pricing such as from other contracts or open market pricing. The contractor shall identify where the pricing is
from. The Contracting Officer will use this information in determining that the Government is getting a fair and reasonable price.

1.3.2 Open Market ODCs
For any open market items (items not on contractor’s or a Teaming Partner’s GSA schedule) over $3000 that are required during the
performance of the task order, the CO/PM must be notified immediately so the purchase can be made by [AGENCY].
