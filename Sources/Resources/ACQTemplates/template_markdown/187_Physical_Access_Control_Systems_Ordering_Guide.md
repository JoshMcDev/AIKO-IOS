Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) Customer Ordering Guide
Purpose
This purpose of this document is create a comprehensive ordering guide that assists ordering
agencies, particularly contracting officers, to effectively use the GSA Multiple Award Schedules
(MAS) to purchase total solutions for Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). This Ordering
Guide is not a stand-alone reference - it is recommended that the reader also become familiar
with the MAS Desk Reference Spring 2019 and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 8.4,
Federal Supply Schedules, and other source documentation listed on page 15, Reference
Documents. This Ordering Guide may be revised from time to time. Updates to this publication,
when they occur, will be available on the web, www.gsa.gov/firesecurity.
Additional information available to assist ordering agencies in purchasing PACS solutions is
available online at https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/listof-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement this site includes links to other useful
GSA websites. Questions concerning this ordering guide should be directed to a Contracting
Officer or Manager in the Schedule category Security & Protection/Security Systems, identified on
page 14, GSA Points of Contact.

Background
Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 [HSPD-12], dated August 2004, mandates the
establishment of a government-wide standard for identity credentials for executive branch
employees and contractors to improve physical security in federally controlled facilities. In
February 2005, Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) released the required standard as Federal Information Processing Standards Publication
(FIPS) 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors. The
current version is FIPS 201-2, dated August 2013. The new smart card based credential is called
he PIV card, which employs microprocessor-based smart card technology, and is designed to be
counterfeit-resistant, tamper-resistant, and interoperable across Federal government facilities.
The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for supporting the adoption of
Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) technologies throughout the Federal
Government. As part of that responsibility, GSA operates and maintains the FICAM Testing
Program. Vendor products are evaluated and approved under this program are placed on the
Approved Products List (APL) to enable procurement of conformant products by implementing
agencies. Agencies can view the APL at www.idmanagement.gov and use GSA Schedules to
purchase compliant solutions.

Recent Policy Announcements
On July 27, 2016, OMB released an update to its Circular A-130, Managing Information as a
Strategic Resource. This 85-page memo sets policy and establishes guidance for management of
Federal information resources. The previous version of Circular A-130 was published in 2000.
The following aspects of the update will be significant to customers involved with logical and
physical access control, smart card technology, identity management, and associated Security &
Protection/Security Systems:
Planning, budgeting and funding - Agencies shall establish agency-wide planning and
budgeting processes in accordance with OMB guidance. In addition, agencies shall plan and
budget to upgrade, replace, or retire any information systems for which protections
commensurate with risk cannot be effectively implemented. As part of the budgeting process,
agencies must identify gaps between planned and actual cost, schedule, and performance goals
and develop a corrective action plan to close such gaps.
Governance - In support of agency missions and business needs and in coordination with
program managers, agencies shall define, implement, and maintain processes, standards, and
policies applied to all information resources at the agency, in accordance with OMB guidance.
Leadership and Workforce - Agencies are required to designate a Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP) who has agency-wide responsibility and accountability for ensuring compliance
with applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks.
Among other things, OMB Circular A-130 mandates that the General Services Administration,
“ensure that contract vehicles and services made available to agencies are cost-effective and
provide for capabilities that are consistent with Government-wide requirements.” To that end,
we have prepared this PACS Customer Ordering Guide to assist our customer agencies with
acquiring compliant, total PACS solutions that are available through our Multiple Award
Schedules (MAS) program.

What is PACS?
In its basic form, Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) are a particular type of access control
system used as an electronic security counter-measure. PACS can be used to control employee
and visitor access to a facility and within controlled interior areas. Within the federal
government, compliant PACS solutions are made up of three distinct categories, which are the
(1) Infrastructure, (2) Certificate Validation System, and (3) Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
Card Readers. More information and diagrams about these major categories is discussed below.
The PACS Infrastructure is made up of many compatible and interoperable software and
hardware components that may include the software application and server (head-end), database,
panels, door controllers, and a workstation. The PACS Infrastructure typically interoperates with
4

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Video Management Systems (VMS), and Visitor
Management Systems.
The Certificate Validation System provides the necessary functions to perform identification
and authentication of the individual using the PIV ID card. It is made up of several compatible
and interoperable components that may include: servers, validation software that acts as an
interface between the card reader and the door controller, and registration and managemen
software. Validation Systems are generally made up of software and hardware components.
They can operate on a physical server or cloud-based solution.
The PIV Card Reader is an accepting device that performs functions to interact with the bearer
of the credential and the credential itself via the Certificate Validation System. It is installed a
an access point, door, portal, or gateway. A PIV Card Reader may be a wholly-integrated unit,
or it may be an assembly of components including a smart card reader, LCD display; LED lights,
audio, PIN pad, Fingerprint/biometric sensors, etc.

As an end-user agency, where do I start and what steps are involved?
The PACS technologies deployed in most Federal buildings are facility-centric and many are no
interoperable with other systems. An identity credential issued by one PACS may not have
capability to be used by another. It is essential that each agency develop strategies to modernize
its PACS to standardized methods as required in FIPS 201-2.
Before moving into the acquisition phase of acquiring a new FIPS 201-2 approved PACS
solution, an agency should first review existing policies on access control and ensure it is in
compliance with OMB Memorandum M-19-17. Next, an agency will need to perform an internal
risk assessment of their existing access control systems. This step involves taking an inventory of
available equipment, and identifying risks and vulnerabilities.
Once a risk assessment is complete, the next step is developing a migration strategy for moving
facilities over to the new APL PACS solution. Continuity of operations planning will be essential
o the success of a migration from a deployed PACS to PIV-enabled PACS. Customers will need
o be cognizant of the project budget and total cost of ownership.
Each agency has its own unique operational environment. Agencies vary in size, organizational
structure, and geographic locations. An agency’s PACS requirement is driven by its mission.
The areas accessible via different access points within a facility do not all have the same security
requirements. A facility may need multiple authentication levels depending on the types of
people in the building (visitors, employees, contractors). The designation of “Controlled,
Limited, Exclusion” areas within a facility, are typically used when drawing up a plan.

More information on PIV authentication factors can be found at the NIST Special Publication
(SP) 800-116 Rev 1.

After identifying the acceptable authentication factors by access areas for the facility in question,
a customer agency should draft a Statement of Work (SOW) that outlines all of the required
system upgrades or replacement, and then work to secure the necessary funding for the
acquisition.
It is necessary that agencies procure a FICAM APL compliant PACS solution in accordance with
he Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). GSA has a whole host of FIPS 201 Compliant and
legacy PACS solutions and services available for agencies to purchase through our Multiple
Award Schedules (MAS) Program. Please refer to FAR 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules and the
next topic on pages 9-10.

Where do I purchase PACS Solutions from GSA?
GSA has a number of FIPS 201 Compliant and legacy PACS solutions and services available for
agencies to purchase through the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Program. More information
about the certified service component for PACS can be found at the Secure Technology Alliance.
Before an agency customer issues its PACS security solicitation with GSA, it is important take
ime to consider the breadth and scope of the project. As stated previously, PACS are used as an
8

electronic security counter-measure to control employee and visitor access to a facility. In so
doing, PACS are designed to safeguard government assets. For this reason, we direct customers
o use Security & Protection category, Security & Protection/Security Systems subcategory, as
he main Schedule vehicle for PACS requirements.
Under GSA Security & Protection/Security Systems, the following Special Item Numbers

How do I purchase a PACS Solution using GSA eBuy?
GSA’s eBuy is an online Request for Quotation (RFQ) tool. eBuy is designed to facilitate the
request for submission of quotations for a wide range of commercial supplies (products) and
services, like PACS, under the GSA Schedules Program offerings.
Federal government agencies can use eBuy to post RFQs, and State and local governmen
entities can use eBuy to post RFQs for GSA Schedule supplies and services under
he Cooperative Purchasing Program.
When using GSA Schedules to request quotes for a PACS solution, first prepare an RFQ
(including the SOW and evaluation criteria) in accordance with FAR 8.4 and post it on eBuy to
afford all Schedule PACS contractors a reasonable amount of time and opportunity to respond.
See list of applicable SINs on previous page. If a facility site visit is needed, please be sure to
provide the date, time, location, and method to properly register for a visit.

9

After the RFQ has closed, evaluate all responses received using the evaluation criteria provided
in the RFQ to the schedule contractors. The ordering agency is responsible for considering the
level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform a specific task being ordered, and for
determining that the total price offered is reasonable. Next, document the award rationale and
issue the task order to the schedule contractor that represents the best overall value to the
Government. After award, send out notifications of the award decision through eBuy or via
email. After vendors have received notification of the agency’s award decision, be prepared to
provide a brief explanation of the award rationale to any unsuccessful offerors upon request.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the GSA Schedule Program?
The GSA Schedule program provides eligible ordering activities with a simplified process for
obtaining supplies and services. Simply put, the Schedule is comprised of companies that supply
commercial supplies and services through contracts awarded by GSA. With over 20,000
contracts in place, the program offers tremendous choice and flexibility. Schedule contracts are
Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts awarded to responsible companies tha
offer commercial supplies or services at fair and reasonable prices. These contracts can be used
by eligible ordering activities worldwide. After GSA awards the contracts, ordering activities
order from Schedule contractors and deliveries are made directly to the customer.
FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, prescribes procedures that ordering activities mus
follow when issuing orders against Schedules. By placing an order against a Schedule contract,
he ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR
2.101, Definitions) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet the government’s
need.
Orders placed against a Schedule contract:
❖ Are not exempt from acquisition planning as required by FAR Part 7 and agency supplements
❖ Must follow the ordering procedures set forth in FAR 8.405-1 or -2
❖ May be set aside for small businesses at the discretion of the ordering activity Contracting
Officer
❖ Are not exempt from an information technology acquisition strategy as required by FAR Par
39
❖ Are not exempt from the requirements for a bundled contract when the order meets the
definition of “bundled contract” (refer to FAR 2.101 and 13.303-2(c)(3))
The terms and conditions, including all clauses, are available for viewing for the Schedule
hrough the GSA eLibrary. An ordering activity may add terms and conditions to an order that do

10

not conflict with the Schedule contract terms and conditions. Use caution when adding terms and
conditions to a Schedule order to ensure that no violation of CICA occurs.
What is the difference between General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award
Schedule and the Approved Products List (APL)?
GSA Schedule is a purchasing vehicle for a broad range of products and services. The resources
available on the GSA Schedule have pre-approved vendors and pre-negotiated ceiling rates. The
APL is a list of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) related products and
services that have been tested per an approved NIST test procedure. An agency can use the GSA
Security & Protection/Security Systems subcategory to purchase a compliant PACS Solution tha
is included on the APL.
How do I verify that I am obtaining a fully-compliant FICAM APL PACS Solution?
The FICAM Testing Program is done so on an end-to-end solution basis, not individual
components. This means that every new vendor configuration of a PACS solution that is
approved is unique from the others listed on the APL. A fully-compliant PACS will have APL
Certificate Numbers for each of the three (3) main areas of (1) Infrastructure, (2) Validation and,
(3) PIV Card Readers, and must be installed properly by a CSEIP personnel. See example below
from the APL.

Who May Purchase from the GSA Schedule?
Federal agencies and other activities are eligible to use GSA sources pursuant to the Federal
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 or other statutory authority. An eligible
ordering activity is authorized to place orders or establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)
against GSA Schedule contracts. Additional information and a complete list of eligible users are
located at www.gsa.gov/eligibilitytouse.

Statutory and Regulatory Foundation Statutory Authority for the MAS Program Title III of the
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) and Title 40,
U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies, are the two statutes that authorize the MAS
program. The statute states that the use of the GSA Schedule is a competitive contracting
procedure since participation in the program has been open to all responsible prospective
contractors and orders and contracts under such procedures result in the lowest overall cos
alternative to meet the needs of the government.
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides the primary regulatory guidance for the
GSA Schedule program. FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, prescribes procedures tha
federal government ordering activities must follow when issuing orders using the GSA Schedule.
Orders placed following these procedures are considered to be issued using full and open
competition. (See FAR 8.404(a).)
May State and Local agencies also purchase PACS off the MAS Program?
Yes, under GSA’s Cooperative Purchasing Program state, local and tribal governments to
purchase from Cooperative Purchasing approved industry partners under Security &
Protection/Security Systems at any time, for any reason, using any funds available. The
icon and
icon in both GSA eLibrary and GSAAdvantage indicate that authorized state and
local government entities may purchase items from these contracts.
State and local government entities are encouraged to use existing Schedule ordering procedures
(refer to FAR Subpart 8.4), but are not required to do so. State and local governments must mee
heir own state or local purchasing and competitive requirements when purchasing via the
Schedule. State and local preference programs are not waived or otherwise affected by these
regulations.
What are the competition requirements under the GSA MAS Program?
FAR 8.4 states that orders and BPAs placed against the Schedule program are considered to be
issued pursuant to full and open competition as long as the ordering procedures are followed.
The Schedule program meets the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA).
Reference 41 United States Code 259(b)(3)(A) and FAR 6.102(d)(3). An acquisition is
12

considered to have been conducted under adequately competitive procedures when ordering
activities follow the ordering procedures of FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. By
placing an order against a Schedule contract, the ordering activity has concluded that the order
represents the best value (as defined in FAR 2.101, Definitions) and results in the lowest overall
cost alternative to meet the government’s need.

following memoranda:
OMB Memorandum M-05-24 [M-05-24], Question 5.
"A. Requirement to use federally approved products and services – To ensure governmentwide interoperability, all departments and agencies must acquire products and services that are
approved to be compliant with the Standard and included on the approved products list.
B. Use of GSA Acquisition Services - Third paragraph states:
Departments and agencies are encouraged to use the acquisition services provided by GSA. Any
agency making procurements outside of GSA vehicles for approved products must certify the
products and services procured meet all applicable federal standards and requirements,
ensure interoperability and conformance to applicable federal standards for the lifecycle of
he components, and maintain a written plan for ensuring ongoing conformance to
applicable federal standards for the lifecycle of the components."

This provides GSA with the authority to act as executive agent for OMB to ensure that the
Program serves the needs of the federal enterprise in an inclusive manner to the various
standards, requirements, interoperability and conformance as applied within the execution of
HSPD-12.

The Program is not the only place that is focused on improvements to E-PACS as a FICAMconformant solution. The latest Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
guidance in NIST SP 800-53-4, dated April 2013 [SP800-53-4] adds new focus to FICAM
conformance and security. It now includes E-PACS and provides focus on its importance as a
Cyber Security initiative of the Federal enterprise. One of the core controls guiding FICAM
conformance in using PIV and PIV-I is:
IA-5(2) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT; PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION The
information system, for PKI-based authentication:
(a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an
accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information;
(b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
(c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
(d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the network".
Per [M-05-24] Question 5.B paragraph 3, Departments and agencies are required to
use products and services selected from the GSA APL.
“Any agency making procurements outside of GSA vehicles for approved products mus
certify the products and services procured meet all applicable federal standards and
requirements, ensure interoperability and conformance to applicable federal standards for
he lifecycle of the components, and maintain a written plan for ensuring ongoing
conformance to applicable federal standards for the lifecycle of the components.”
The Program’s [FRTC] meets this requirement for E-PACS solutions. It is recommended
[FRTC] be used as the baseline for any agency’s testing program should the agency seek
o certify E-PACS products and services independently of the APL.
