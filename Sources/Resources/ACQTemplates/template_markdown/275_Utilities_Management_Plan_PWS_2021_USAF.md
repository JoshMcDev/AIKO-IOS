1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Mission
The Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) Operations Directorate, Asset Visibility
Division, Utilities Branch (AFCEC/COAU) is responsible for facilitating Built Infrastructure
Assessments (BIA) for utility distribution systems on Air Force Bases (AFBs) in accordance
with (IAW) the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) guidance. It is the Government’s intent to
procure contracted services to produce installation Utilities Management Plans (UMPs) for two
pilot test installations.
1.2 Purpose
Engineering Services are required for assessing the current state of built infrastructure associated
with the utility systems at Robins AFB, GA (RAFB) and Moody AFB, GA (MAFB) as pilo
bases, to develop an installation comprehensive UMP and develop short-term sustainment (1-4
years) and long-term (5-10 years) investment requirements for asset managemen
implementation at each base. A cohesive workflow of our UMP Sub-Activity graph
representation is shown in Figure 1. The UMP Sub-Activity Integration Strategy incorporates
system studies, Installation Maps Data Update, and transforms Grid Maps into Actionable
Installation Geospatial Intelligence for the larger Enterprise Utilities Sustainment Managemen
System (SMS) to effectively inform decision to invest in the right asset that is right-sized, and a
he right time. The Government plans to utilize the UMP for improving AF asset visibility, asse
management planning, developing executable programming tools, achieving sound and riskbalanced investment decision making to restore, modernize and recapitalize requirements for
sustaining our utility infrastructure, and drive innovation in asset management. The Air Force
Civil Engineer community will use the UMP for project scoring, future programming, and
providing cost information for identified initiatives to ensure our utility infrastructure is
constructed, operated, sustained, and maintained at the lowest overall lifecycle cost.

(gpcd) (40 CFR 35.2120).
b. Infiltration Standard: Average Daily Wet Weather Flow will be less than 120 gallons per
capita day (gpcd) (40 CFR 35.2120).
c. Peaking Factor in sewer trunk lines will be less than 4.0 (Divide maximum hourly flow
measured during rain event by the average daily flow measured during dry weather.

3.4.4.1 Required Work
Work includes identifying where and to what extent, in the collection system, I&I problem areas
exist, and what rehabilitations, repairs, and/or replacements to the system are necessary to bring
he system into standard.
This inflow/infiltration analysis is being performed to demonstrate the non-existence or possible
existence of excessive inflow/infiltration in each sewer system tributary to the treatment works.
Through a systematic investigation of the sewer system, the analysis should identify the
presence, flow rate, and type of inflow/infiltration conditions which exist in the sewer system.
The systematic investigation should include an analysis of the following which will be provided
by the Government as available:
a) Existing wastewater collection system;
b) Estimates of average residential, industrial, commercial and institution wastewater flows
(which are used for general background but, not usually necessary for I&I
determinations);
c) Groundwater levels should be available from Bases IRP monitoring well data;
d) Continuous flow monitoring and in some cases flow isolation monitoring;
e) Determination of inflow and infiltration rates; and recommendations for further
investigation when appropriate. Cross-connections to storm water conveyance systems
will be enumerated and described.
3.4.4.2 Surveys
The Contractor shall survey sanitary sewer laterals 4” in diameter or greater, connecting to each
building to determine general pipe condition and potential for I&I. Specifically, the Contractor
shall evaluate the sewer laterals, via historical service calls, shop personnel interviews, and

The Contractor shall utilize G-tabs and as-built drawings and personal knowledge of shop
personnel, as available, to determine age, size, and composition of sewer lateral piping.
Lateral piping conditions for similar buildings of contemporaneous construction and material
may be determined by direct inspection of a representative sample of those building laterals. For
example, if a block of buildings built to the same general design, at the same time, are
determined to include 10 sewer lateral connections, and direct examination of two of those
laterals indicate 4-inch, ceramic piping with open joints discovers pipe cracks, breaks and roo
intrusion, a similar condition can be assumed for all related laterals constructed in that same
period and area without further inspection.
3.4.4.3 Flow Monitoring
The Contractor shall conduct flow monitoring of the sanitary and industrial sewer systems for a
minimum duration of 60-days during time-periods which have the greatest chance of significan
rainfall events (at least 1-inch rainfall). The Contractor may utilize area-velocity flow meters in
gravity sewer lines, lift station pump cycle records, and/or information captured downstream in

main sub-basin flow monitoring. Installation of flow meters shall also be positioned at ends of
pipes in outfall manholes in at least 12 locations. Flow data shall be used to identify areas with
potential for significant I&I issues or other illicit discharge. Should the flow monitoring data
indicate significant I&I problems those areas or sub-basins shall be further investigated. To the
extent that site conditions allow it, the Contractor shall attempt to meter in the same locations
hat were metered during the previous I&I study (if applicable) so that comparisons can be made
o previous flow data. However, the Contractor shall perform field reconnaissance to field-verify
sub-basins and potential meter locations and select the number and location of metering sites tha
is most appropriate to accomplish the objectives of this SOW. The Contractor shall evaluate
historical rainfall patterns and perform flow metering during a season in which it can be expected
o capture periods of both dry weather and wet weather. If necessary, the Contractor shall
accommodate drought conditions by extending the 60-day monitoring of flow meters.
The Contractor shall be responsible for all flow measurement device maintenance and data
collection, including calibration and measurement device cleaning. Routine maintenance shall be
performed, and recorded flow shall be logged, along with other significant information. For each
flow monitoring site, the Contractor shall develop a weekly hydrograph, with any rainfall data
superimposed thereon.
The Contractor shall collect data regarding wastewater flows, rainfall, and potable water
consumption. The Contractor shall utilize this data to assist in determining at minimum the
following flow components:
a) Base flow (water consumed and discharged to the sanitary sewer system)
b) Effective population and rate of consumption (gpcd)
c) Peak hydraulic flow (peak hour and peak day)
d) Average daily wet weather flow
e) Peak wet weather flow
f) Peaking factor (maximum hourly flow measured during rain event divided by the average
daily flow measured during dry weather)
g) I&I
3.4.4.4 Inspection Methods
CCTV inspection will be based on data gathered by visual inspection, flow monitoring, smoke
and dye testing, SSO locations and empirical information. It is estimated that the Contractor will
be required to hydraulically clean and perform CCTV inspections, IAW the listed standards or
he regulatory-approved equivalent, of not to exceed 10% of total wastewater mains. The CCTV
inspection will identify structural pipeline defects, cracks, offset joints, obstructions, grade
problems, and sources of groundwater infiltration and escaping sewage. CCTV inspection
recordings shall be clearly marked, identifying the exact line inspected. Damaged sections of
line revealed by the inspections should be identified through detailed narrations and descriptions.
Defects observed in each line segment should be summarized on a CCTV inspection line.
Digital photographs should be taken in line segments to show typical defects and conditions of
hat line.

3.4.4.5 Rehabilitation Plan
The Rehabilitation Plan will present recommendations for correcting any significant I&I
problems encountered during the study and include a draft DD Form 1391 document(s) for the
construction of recommended corrective actions. The rehabilitation plan will include a detailed
report including prioritization of the problem areas in tabular form, the location and
identification of I&I problems along with a description of all violations of local, state, or federal
regulations, quantity of wastewater line and the number of manholes requiring repair or
replacement, and estimated costs for rehabilitation. Rehabilitation recommendations shall be
based on costs, anticipated success ratios, wastewater removal rates and longevity of each repair
method or combination of methods as appropriate. Identify alternatives considered and provide
justification for the repair methods selected. Potential repair methods to be evaluated shall
include, but not be limited to joint sealing, slip lining, insertion lining, point repairs, inflow
source disconnections, soil stabilization, fold and form, line replacement, and pipe bursting. All
sections of wastewater lines found in noncompliance of local, state, and federal regulations will
be recommended for rehabilitation.
A programming-level construction cost estimate will be prepared for each segment of the work
and for each corrective action so that programming decisions can be made. Costs shall be based
on past experience and local conditions and shall be developed in tabular form to take into
account line size, materials of construction, and approximate depths of pipes. Cost estimates
should be quantified to major components and systems sufficient to support the preparation of
costs estimates to be included in the draft DD Form 1391. Document additional costs incurred
due to the excessive I&I condition and estimate in coordination with the COR the intangible
costs because of the excessive I&I. Using the direct and intangible costs develop return on
investment calculations for the project and phases using simple payback (no interest) methods.

When reviewing inconsistencies between mapping data, decisions will be made regarding which
data is most reliable. Either the GeoBase data will remain, or will be overwritten with other
information. If overwritten, the metadata will be changed to indicate when it was overwritten and
why. For example, the metadata field for an 8-inch water main may read “Mapped diameter of
his pipe changed from 12” to 8.” Storm water replacement as-built drawings dated 01 June
2002” indicated 8” pipe. Inspections of Manholes 432 and 433 conducted 26 October 2008
