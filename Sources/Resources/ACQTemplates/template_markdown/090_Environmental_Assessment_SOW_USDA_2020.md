Introduction

GSA’s Office of Telecommunications Services (OTS) has developed this Fair Opportunity and Ordering
Guide for Ordering Contracting Officers (OCOs) and other stakeholders to facilitate the use of the
Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) contracts and ensure a successful, timely, and orderly transition
of telecommunications services from expiring legacy contracts – Networx, WITS 3, and GSA Regional
Local Services. Now that the EIS contracts have been awarded, agencies should accelerate their
planning efforts or risk having services disconnected when current contracts expire.
EIS is a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract – also known as a task
order contract. A task order is the official contractual mechanism that will be used by agencies to order
supplies and/or services under EIS. All task orders are subject to fair opportunity as defined in Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505. The FAR requires that all awardees under a multiple award
contract be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each
ask order in excess of $3,500, unless an exception applies.
The Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide provides a step-by- This Guide focuses on Fair

adherence to the EIS contract, applicable laws, the FAR, and
any additional agency policy and regulations.
The Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide is one of several resources GSA has developed to assis
agencies with their transition to EIS and the award of task orders against the EIS contracts. Throughou
he Guide, references and hyperlinks 1 are provided to other GSA guides, tools, and resources that offer
additional details associated with specific task order acquisition activities. Due to the importance of
ransition, the Guide focuses heavily on ordering during transition; however, most of the activities and
practices discussed are applicable for all ordering actions performed under EIS.

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Overview

Fair opportunity and ordering activities are organized within three distinct phases – Acquisition
Planning; Acquisition Decision and Task Order Award; and Administration. The first phase, Acquisition
Planning, includes key activities that focus on the agency’s inventory and requirements, the acquisition
strategy, and the Fair Opportunity solicitation. The second phase, Acquisition Decision and Task Order
Award, involves offer evaluation, contractor selection, and task order award. The third phase,

during transition or later in the EIS period of performance, agencies must follow the fair opportunity
requirement set out in FAR 16.505(b)(1). A summary of FAR requirements is provided in Appendix A.
Requirements vary based on the total value of the task order. And regardless of when the task order is
awarded, all task orders end on the expiration date of their respective contracts. Best practice
approaches to comply with fair opportunity requirements are explained in detail throughout the Guide.
Appendix A also includes a description of the exceptions to the fair opportunity process allowed by FAR
16.505(b)(2).

Acquisition Planning

The Acquisition Planning phase begins with the establishment of the Integrated Procurement Team
(IPT), execution of a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) with GSA, and registration for access to
GSA tools. The team will then set out to analyze the agency’s current inventory, develop service
requirements, and draft the solicitation. Careful planning and preparation will satisfy FAR requirements
and further ensure that the fair opportunity and ordering process is straightforward, manageable, and
results in the best value with respect to the product, service, or solutions procured.
As you begin to plan fair opportunity and structure task orders, let us know the issues that you face –
and we will help. Whether it is a challenge, an opportunity, or a problem, GSA will address your issues in
he form of a use case. We will respond with alternatives and suggestions. We will also regularly

update this guide to share your solutions with others facing similar issues. Refer to Appendix B for
details on submitting your issues.

3.1

Establish Integrated Procurement Team

The agency’s IPT will direct and manage fair opportunity and task order
award activities. The IPT will be comprised of one or more individuals Your IPT should be in
depending on the size of the organization and the volume and complexity place and aggressively
of their service requirements. For most agencies, the IPT will be directly planning transition now
led by the OCO who will make the Fair Opportunity Decision and select an that EIS contracts have
offeror(s) for task order award(s). The team must have full access to been awarded
relevant skill sets: including contracting, telecommunications, security,
network engineering, financial, transition, and implementation. Team membership should include
individuals with telecommunications expertise in both legacy and emerging technologies – who
understand the agency’s mission and supporting infrastructure and have a thorough knowledge of the
agency’s future operational goals and objectives. Depending on the geographic scope of the agency’s
requirements, teams may need members with an understanding of both the local service sectors
currently serviced by GSA Regional and WITS contracts, as well as the national and international service
environment under Networx. As the IPT moves through the task order acquisition phases, additional
eam members may be added in response to the workload and scope of the effort.
3.1.1 Complete Delegation of Procurement Authority
The OCO or other officials with authority to obligate funds for the agency (or tribe, or other entity
authorized to use the contract per GSA order OGP 4800.2I) must receive a Delegation of Procuremen
Authority from GSA prior to submitting a solicitation to GSA for an in-scope review, before issuing the
solicitation, and before awarding a task order under EIS. To receive a DPA, the OCO must first complete
EIS DPA training through the Defense Acquisition University (DAU)- course FAC066, send a copy of the
certification to eis_dpa@gsa.gov, request a DPA by filling out the DPA form, and be given authority by a
GSA EIS Contracting Officer (CO). The purpose of the DPA is to ensure that the roles and responsibilities
between the EIS GSA CO and agency OCO are clearly established and comply with the Office of
Management and Budget’s (OMB) Executive Agent designation to GSA. An agency may have multiple
OCOs as long as each has been issued a DPA by GSA – the DPA cannot be re-delegated by the agency.
The authority granted to an OCO under a DPA is limited to the EIS contracts and those task orders
awarded and administered by an OCO under the EIS contracts.
3.1.2 Register for Access to GSA Tools
Agencies are encouraged to register for access to GSA’s next generation business management platform,
Conexus. The system will provide ordering, billing, and inventory functionality to EIS customer agencies.
Conexus will automate processes and data exchanges that are currently manual, and will capture and
make available applicable contract deliverables, billing records, inventory data, and service level
agreement (SLA) management reports through a secure authenticated web interface. Agencies that op
o not register for access to Conexus may obtain their deliverables by e-mail by requesting such from
heir contractor or by accessing the data through their contractor’s web interface. Agencies that require
5

their deliverables in another format (e.g., Excel), or delivered by another means (e.g., direct data
exchange) must specify their requirements in their task order. See Section 3.6.2 for more guidance for
improved billing management.
Another valuable GSA tool, the Agency EIS Pricer Tool, provides agencies with pricing output to help
with research and budget development of their Fair Opportunity solicitations. The Agency EIS Pricer
Tool, along with a user guide and procedures to access the Agency EIS Pricer Tool, is available through
he EIS website.
Visit EIS Resources for more details on GSA-provided tools and resources.

3.2

Compile Inventory

A comprehensive understanding of the “as-is” state of the agency’s telecommunications services and
infrastructure is the point of departure to develop EIS service requirements going forward. To facilitate
he EIS transition, GSA has developed, validated, and maintains an EIS Transition Inventory (TI). Building
on lessons learned from previous transitions, GSA assembled and validated TI to relieve the agencies of
he burden of this labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Validation consisted of a comprehensive
comparison of billing and inventory data collected by GSA from the Networx, WITS 3, and Regional Local
Service contracts with equivalent data maintained by the service providers on those vehicles. The TI
establishes a baseline of services that must be disconnected from expiring contracts and provides
information for planning and transition of services to EIS. Refer to the Transition Inventory User Guide
for more detail on TI, as well as directions on creating an account in GSA’s E-MORRIS system where the
inventory resides. Agencies may also contact the EIS Transition Coordination Center (TCC) a
eistcc.inventory@gsa.gov for TI-related issues.

3.3

Deliver Agency Transition Plan

In preparation for transition, each agency should develop and submit an Agency Transition Plan (ATP).
The ATP is an important tool for communicating the agency’s requirements, expectations, and approach
o other transition stakeholders, including GSA, OMB, and support contractors. The ATP should describe
he agency’s transition strategy, priorities, and objectives in conjunction with its approach to making fair
opportunity decisions and ordering. Refer to the Transition Handbook for further detail on the ATP.

3.4

Define Service Requirements

EIS service requirements are driven by the agency’s mission and operational environment.
Requirements analysis begins with an assessment of an agency’s current inventory of
elecommunications services – the “as is” state – and ends with the definition of the “to-be” future state
of the agency’s telecommunications solutions.
The IPT will determine how EIS service offerings

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

transition. The analysis will also determine how the agency’s service requirements should be partitioned
into individual service groups prior to undergoing fair opportunity.
GSA recommends that agencies specify requirements functionally and allow offerors the flexibility to
propose best-value solutions. Alternatively, the team may determine – on a service-by-service basis –
which services must be transitioned like-for-like and which services must be migrated to new
echnologies. Teams should also consider changes to the future volume and mix of service
requirements, as well as changes in the agency’s geographic footprint and user demographics that are
expected throughout the task order period of performance. For example, new applications or cloud
computing implementations may increase and alter the agency’s bandwidth needs. The IPT must engage
all stakeholders to ensure new requirements are accurately assessed. The results of an agency’s
requirements analysis will be documented in a Statement of Work (SOW), a Performance Work
Statement (PWS), or Statement of Objectives (SOO). Appendix C provides a like-for-like mapping of
Networx, WITS, and GSA Regional services to EIS services. A listing of EIS service areas, service names,
service IDs, and CLIN prefixes is also provided. For further details, refer to the EIS Service Guides for
complete descriptions of all services available on the contract. Together these resources should prove
useful in translating the agency’s current inventory to EIS services.
Sections below address in greater detail the concept of service groups and discuss the tradeoffs in
documenting EIS requirements within a SOW, PWS or a SOO. Appendix D provides examples of
flexibility available to agencies employing performance-based solicitations.
3.4.1 Define Service Groups

a key element of the acquisition strategy and will set the course of the

based/enterprise-wide
requirements,
service/technology-based
requirements, or a combination of these forms. Groups may be based
on service clusters (internet protocol services, dedicated services), technology (voice, data), geographic
location (Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs)), or any logical clustering of requirements as determined
by individual agency needs – such as diversity, redundancy, or unique performance measures. Small
agencies or bureaus may combine and compete all required EIS services at all locations within a single
group. Large agencies with diverse service requirements will usually define multiple groups – based on
service/technology, network, location, or users. The strategy employed to group services may
incorporate factors such as organizational structure and size, agency mission, implementation schedule,
arget technical architecture – both current and future – and time and resources available to transition.
How an agency’s service requirements are grouped may impact the proposed prices, workload to
evaluate offers, and resources to implement task orders. More groups will generally equate to more
complex evaluations, more task orders, a longer transition timeline, and greater administrative burden.
7
v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

Fewer groups may streamline the fair opportunity process and simplify transition to EIS. Agencies should
consider the tradeoffs. For example, more service groups will likely attract more vendor interest, a
wider variety of potential solutions, and possibly better pricing. With more groups, niche service
providers can selectively choose where to compete and large providers can propose across multiple
groups and offer economies of scale. Fewer service groups will lead to fewer awards and fewer
contractors to oversee – resulting in a more manageable operational lifecycle.
Service groups may be packaged within individual solicitations or the agency may elect to combine
multiple service groups into a single solicitation. Moreover, some service groups may be included as
“optional” for greater flexibility where future quantities, locations, or other factors affecting the volume
of services required are unknown but can be described and estimated within the solicitation. Combining
multiple groups within a single solicitation may complicate the evaluation but will likely have a shorter
critical path to task order award and offer greater flexibility to manage acquisition tradeoffs.
Considerations on how best to develop solicitations are discussed at greater length below.
3.4.2 Document Service Requirements
After the agency’s service requirements have been determined, the IPT will document those
requirements within a SOW, PWS, or a SOO. A SOW is typically used when service requirements are
well-defined and can be described in specific terms – for example, where the agency requires a like-forlike service transition with required Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) already established on the
contract, or if the agency has precise future plans that can be defined in terms of specific EIS services.
Use of the uniform contract format (UCF) for the solicitation, and the assistance of GSA with the
Solicitation Assist Tool, can facilitate proposal preparation and lead to a straightforward evaluation and
comparison between offeror pricing. A PWS and a SOO emphasize performance-based measures such
as desired service outcomes and performance standards. A SOO establishes high-level outcomes and
objectives for performance while a PWS describes outcomes and objectives at a more detailed and
measurable level. A PWS or SOO is often appropriate where the agency requires a transformative
solution and desires to provide maximum flexibility for offerors to propose innovative approaches. It is
still important for the agency to establish functional technical requirements, especially for new
echnologies. There is also the option of using a SOW and encouraging offerors to propose alternative
approaches as desired, which is similar to the suggestions provided in Appendix D. Regardless of which
approach is used, the SOW/PWS/SOO must include the agency’s TI and service locations – as well as any
government furnished equipment (GFE) that will be transitioned to EIS – along with service
requirements.
When developing requirements, agencies should be mindful of practices that can facilitate or expedite
he task order award process and reduce price. For example:
• Minimize custom service level agreements or billing requirements beyond those specified in the
EIS contracts. If an agency requires a better key performance indicator (KPI) or SLA associated
with a fixed price CLIN, the proposed task order specific price may be higher than the contrac
price. If using a different KPI or SLA than the one in the contract, the agency can use the same
CLIN and the contractor will update table J.2.10.2.3.5. If making significant requirements

changes to the CLIN, e.g., different definition, use a TUC. Provide the transition inventory in
order to fully describe the services to be replaced.
Use pricing tables structured similarly to those in the EIS contracts.
Use fixed price CLINs whenever possible. (Even if a SOO or PWS is used, it is recommended to
encourage proposals that contain a detailed description of the solution and price that uses fixed
price CLINs whenever possible.)

Also bear in mind FAR 16.505 direction:
“Performance-based acquisition methods must be used to the maximum extent practicable.
Individual [task] orders shall clearly describe all services to be performed or supplies to be
delivered so the full cost or price for the performance of the work can be established when
he [task] order is placed.”

3.5

Develop Acquisition Strategy

After requirements have been analyzed and documented and service groups have been defined, the IPT
will complete development of an acquisition strategy. Activities include selection of the acquisition
method that will be followed for each service group and preparation of a formal Acquisition Plan.
3.5.1 Select Acquisition Method
The acquisition method used to conduct fair opportunity is based on several considerations – mos
importantly, the dollar value of the task order and the complexity of the agency’s requirements.
Selection of the acquisition method must also take into account the type of CLINs that will be acquired.
A word about EIS CLINs is helpful here before proceeding with a description of acquisition methods.
Most CLINs on the EIS contracts are fixed priced; however, items not included or priced on the contrac
may be incorporated in task orders if they are within scope. To accommodate agency-specific
requirements, EIS provides three additional CLIN types: Individual Case Basis (ICB) CLINs, Task Order
Unique CLINs (TUCs), and Catalog CLINs. Furthermore, EIS contractors may offer agency-specific price
discounts on fixed price CLINs or may charge more for a fixed price CLIN if the agency requires a better
KPI or SLA. Note that although there are many appropriate use cases, excessive use of TUCs can erode
long-term price efficiencies and increase the likelihood of vendor lock-in. “Bundling” (i.e. combine
multiple contract CLINs into a single TUC) should be used judiciously, and agency requirements that can
be logical additions to an EIS service (e.g., when requiring additional bandwidths for a transport service)
should be procured by adding new CLINs to the EIS contract rather than using TUCs. Each CLIN type is
described in Table 1 below.
Three acquisition methods are available to agencies – one is based solely on price and does not require
a formal solicitation and two are solicitation-based. The best method depends on the dollar value of the
ask order, the complexity of the requirements, and the type of CLINs required. Solicitation-based
acquisition methods must be used where the expected value of the task order exceeds the simplified
acquisition threshold and may be used for lower dollar value solicitations, allowing the agency to take
advantage of possible task order discounts. Notwithstanding the information below, agencies should
refer to FAR 16.505(b) for the specific language regarding fair opportunity and Civilian Agency

v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

Acquisition Council (CAAC) Letter 2018-02 (February 16, 2018) for the current simplified acquisition
hreshold.
1. Price-only. Subject to Section 880 of FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Pub.L.
115-232, agencies may use this acquisition method when all required CLINs are fixed priced on
he EIS contracts or contractor catalogs 2 – and the agency elects to make a fair opportunity
decision based on a single factor, price. This method cannot be used if the requirement includes
ICB CLINs or TUCs as those CLINS are not included or priced on the EIS contracts. Where the
value of the task order is over $3,500 but will not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold,
he OCO need not notify EIS contractors before performing the evaluation or selecting an
awardee. The agency may also use the Agency EIS Pricer Tool to make a price-only FO selection
for a task order in accordance with Fair Opportunity under FAR Subpart 16.505. This could be
useful for pricing well-defined services for which a like-for-like replacement is required. (Note:
The Public EIS Pricer Tool only shows current-year pricing and should not be used for an
evaluation of requirements that extend into future years.) Where the value of the task order
will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, agencies must use a solicitation-based method.
2. Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) with a Solicitation. Subject to Section 880 of FY
2019 NDAA, Pub.L. 115-232, agencies may use the this method when requirements include any
combination of CLIN types – fixed priced CLINs, ICB CLINs, agency-specific TUCs, and Catalog
CLINs – and the agency elects to make a fair opportunity decision based on a technically
acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.
3. Best Value Tradeoff with a Solicitation. This method is appropriate when requirements include
any combination of CLIN types – and the agency elects to include non-price factors (e.g.
echnical, past performance) in addition to price and perform a tradeoff analysis to determine
best value.

ICB CLINs are defined and specified at the contract level but require additional information

place-holders for specific price CLINs so that the service being proposed may be defined and
assigned a unique identifier. For example, OC12 access requires the location, site survey, and

Task Order
Unique CLIN
(TUC)

TUCs represent agency requirements that do not correspond with any of the fixed or defined
ICB CLINs for the service on the EIS contracts. TUCs are used to define and price services tha
1) are not defined and priced on the contract and 2) should not logically be added to the
contract as a new CLIN (e.g. missing bandwidths within a service should be logically added
and are not TUC candidates) and 3) are used to meet agency custom requirements. TUCs and
pricing for TUCs are not added to the EIS contracts by contract modification, but are
incorporated into the contract databases for pricing and billing purposes only. In addition,
TUCs may be used to combine multiple contract CLINs into a single TUC. The OCO mus
determine prices fair and reasonable.

Catalog

EIS has negotiated class discounts for Catalog Item CLINs – for offerings such as cloud,
equipment, and managed services with significant market and price volatility. Catalog CLINs
are maintained by the contractors on contractor-hosted web sites. These items are subjec
o change at the discretion of the contractors in accordance with the terms established in
heir EIS contracts. The OCO must determine prices fair and reasonable.

* NOTE: J.4.1 of the EIS contract states: “3. A TO-specific price for a service that is identical to a service
on contract (i.e., excluding TUCs) shall be equal to or lower than the contract price for the identical
service." Proposing prices that are higher than the contract prices for identical services is considered a
proposal deficiency, with one exception: if an agency requires a better KPI or SLA associated with a fixed
price CLIN, the proposed task order specific price may be higher than the contract price. If the agency is
using a different KPI or SLA than the one in the contract, it can use the same CLIN and the contractor will
update contract table J.2.10.2.3.5. If the agency is making significant requirements changes to the CLIN,
e.g., different definition, it would use a TUC. Agencies are clearly within their rights to drop a proposal
from further consideration for this type of pricing deficiency.
Bear in mind that EIS contractors were not required to price mandatory services in all geographic
locations in order to receive a contract award 4. And not all contractors priced all optional services at the
ime of contract award. Contractors may elect to submit a proposal in response to any notification or
solicitation in cases where the required services or CBSAs are not currently on their contract. In such
cases, the contractor’s proposal must indicate that those services or CBSAs are not on contract and tha
a modification request has been submitted to GSA. Furthermore and most importantly, the contractor’s

With EIS, GSA eliminated the mandatory requirement under Networx Universal to offer so-called “ubiquitous”
geographic coverage. Ubiquity has been replaced by the use of Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) to define
required coverage areas. The minimum offer to qualify for an EIS contract award included pricing for mandatory
services delivered to all government locations in 25 of the top 100 CBSAs – based on service bandwidth. For
additional details refer to the EIS Concepts for CBSAs and refer to gsa.gov/eis for the list of “EIS Services and CBSAs

consider the use of a Request for Information (RFI) – where the agency provides EIS contractors a
snapshot of requirements and details of its acquisition strategy. Contractor responses to meaningful

3.5.2 Prepare Acquisition Plan
The FAR requires that agencies conduct acquisition planning, including
market research, for all federal procurements. FAR 7.1 details acquisition
planning requirements while FAR 10 addresses market research. Written
acquisition plans are generally required for acquisitions exceeding
specific dollar thresholds – identified in the agency’s FAR supplement.
The Acquisition Plan is execution-oriented and contract-focused.

Contents of the solicitation and the complete Acquisition Package are

solicitation. To request a Solicitation Assist visit from GSA, contact your Agency Manager or submit your
request to eistcc.ta@gsa.gov.
As noted earlier, separate solicitations may be prepared for each service group, or agencies may elect to
combine multiple service groups into a single solicitation. A hybrid solicitation may include mix of
service groups – with some groups undergoing LPTA evaluation and others a Best Value Tradeoff
evaluation. Combining multiple service groups within a solicitation will likely lessen the overall workload
for both the agency and EIS contractors. Either case will result in one or more task order awards to one
or more contractors – depending on the solicitation language that specifies differentiation to award to
multiple vendors, the evaluation criteria set out by the agency, and the results of the fair opportunity
competition.
In accordance with EIS contracts Section J.2.10, "the UBI is a contractor-assigned code that uniquely
identifies a group of related services for ordering, billing, and inventory purposes and also uniquely
identifies each component within that grouping" and "the complete UBI shall be unique across the
contract and shall never be reused." It is recommended that agencies include the following language in
heir solicitations to ensure clarity of the UBI requirement:
“The contractor shall assign separate UBIs for each installed item for all types of service orders including
bulk orders in accordance with EIS contract Section J.2.10.1.1.2.. The contractor shall not use a single UBI
for multiple instances.”
For more details on the assignment of UBIs, please refer to Section B.3.1 of the MOPS Handbook.
At this point in the process nearing the conclusion of the Acquisition Planning phase, agencies should
revisit the size and composition of the IPT. If requirements are broken into a large number of service
groups and multiple solicitations are planned, additional team members may be recruited, and the team
divided into sub-teams and assigned specific groups. Depending on the evaluation criteria selected and
he complexity of the target solutions, additional Subject Matter Expert (SME) specialties may be
needed. For the initial transition Fair Opportunity solicitations, it may also be useful to engage agency
staff that will be responsible for the service implementation stages of transition that will follow.

in Table 3. Similarities and differences among the acquisition methods are evident. Procurements
undergoing the Price-only method can be rapidly evaluated and documented. Procurements following

GSA addresses frequently asked questions (FAQs) associated with task order acquisition including how
best to structure a task order and the underlying Fair Opportunity solicitation.
4.3.1

Task Order Content

All EIS task orders must be prepared in accordance with FAR 16.505 and each agency’s supplement. FAR
16.505(a)(2) requires that:
“Individual orders shall clearly describe all services to be performed or supplies to be
delivered so the full cost or price for the performance of the work can be established when
he order is placed. Orders shall be within scope, issued within the period of performance,
and be within the maximum value of the contract.”
Per FAR 16.505(a)(7), task orders shall contain the following information:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.
vii.

Date of order.
Contract number and order number.
For supplies and services, contract item number and description, quantity, and unit price or
estimated cost or fee.

Place of delivery or performance (including consignee).
Any packaging, packing and shipping instructions.
Accounting and appropriation data.

v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

viii.

Method of payment and payment office, if not specified in the contract (Subpart
32.11110(e)).

In addition to task order content called out in the FAR, the task order must identify the name of the OCO
making the award as well as the names of individuals authorized to place service orders under the task
order (CORs officially delegated by the OCO) and any restrictions/limitations to their ordering authority.
Any unique task order deliverables must also be specifically identified in the task order. Mandatory
deliverables required at the EIS contract level need not be identified. Refer to Appendix F for lists of
mandatory contract deliverables and optional task order deliverables.
The OCO or the official with authority to obligate funds must obligate sufficient funds on the task order
o cover the base period of the task order. If the agency has the authority to use incremental funding
for fixed price or time and material task orders, this may also be an option. The funding obligation on
he task order may be a not-to-exceed (NTE) amount.
Regarding the period of performance for task orders, agencies should review their FAR supplement for
agency-specific guidance. If using option years, bear in mind that FAR 17.204(e) states:
“Unless otherwise approved in accordance with agency procedures, the total of the basic
and option periods shall not exceed 5 years in the case of services, and the total of the
basic and option quantities shall not exceed the requirement for 5 years in the case of
supplies.” These limitations do not apply to information technology contracts. However,
statutes applicable to various classes of contracts, for example, the Contract Labor
Standards statute (see 22.1002-1), may place additional restrictions on the length of
contracts.”
The agency should verify whether its organization considers telecommunications to be IT. If
elecommunications is not considered IT, the agency may follow the agency supplemental procedures
for exceeding the 5-year limit. In addition, all task orders end on the expiration date of the contracts on
which they were awarded.
Agencies are encouraged to maximize the task order period of performance consistent with the
expected life of the services procured and agency acquisition policy. Fair opportunity and transition can
be labor intensive, time consuming, and potentially expensive and disruptive – repeating the process on
5-year intervals for services with long lifecycles is generally not efficient. Task orders with periods of
performance of 10 years or more will avoid the need to recompete requirements multiple times.
However, longer periods of performance do not preclude a re-competition at any point beyond the base
period of the task order – if in the agency’s best interest. In fact, a commercial best practice is to no
have a commitment longer than 36 months.
When establishing task orders, note that EIS contract prices are fixed for the 5-year base period and will
be refreshed prior to the exercise of each of the two 5-year contract option periods. Agencies that have
a period of performance longer than 5 years may consider including language in the solicitation that tie
ask order prices for years beyond year 5, or years beyond year 10, to the EIS contract prices when the
17
v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

options are exercised. The price refreshment may result in price increases or price decreases and are
solely based on the Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) process set out in Section H.19 [Economic Price
Adjustment – Price Refreshment] of the EIS contracts. GSA will ensure that pricing for EIS contract CLINs
is fair and reasonable. The agency will be responsible to ensure that TUCs and ICB CLINs are fair and
reasonable.
4.3.2 Task Order Award Restrictions
An EIS contractor does not have to offer all services at all locations or may not have been awarded all
services at all locations. A contractor must have been awarded all mandatory services in a CBSA in order
o be eligible to offer any CBSA-dependent services in that CBSA on a task order.
There are three cases when an OCO may not award a task order until the contractor has modified its EIS
contract:
1. The contractor’s contract does not include a CBSA that is specified in the agency’s solicitation.
2. The contractor’s contract does not include a particular service or service component that is
specified in the agency’s solicitation – and specified in the EIS contracts.
3. The contractor’s contract includes all CBSAs and services specified in the agency’s solicitation
but it does not have the particular required services in the particular required CBSA.
An EIS contractor may respond to a Fair Opportunity solicitation when there is a modification pending
but are required to specify in its proposal that a modification has been submitted to GSA to add the
service or the CBSA to their EIS contract. Agencies should note that the submission of the contrac
modification to GSA is not sufficient to allow the OCO to proceed with the issuance of a task order
award, where the contractor is missing a CBSA, service or service/CBSA combination, or CLIN or
CLIN/Network Site Code combination. The OCO must wait until the contract modification is complete
before making an award.
Additionally, Section H.21 [Notice to Proceed] of the EIS contracts states an awardee:
“…may only accept and process task orders or service orders, provision or deliver services
and bill for services after it receives written notification 1) from the CO that it has passed
Business Support Systems (BSS) testing and 2) from GSA that it has successfully completed
security testing in accordance with G.5.6. [BSS Security Requirements].”
However, an EIS awardee may respond to agency solicitations while it completes the required EIS BSS
verification and security testing. It is recommended that an agency include a requirement in the
solicitation for the contractors to state in their responses whether or not they have successfully
completed the required BSS verification and security testing: this is for information purposes only and
not suggested as an evaluation factor for selecting a contractor.

Order Close-out. Also refer to the Management and Operations Handbook for additional detail on these
and other related topics.

5.1

Place Service Orders under Task Order

The telecommunications industry uses the concept of service orders to order or modify services.
Whenever the FAR references “order” or “orders” it is referring to a task order. Service orders do no
exist in FAR terminology and are similar to a service request. EIS allows for the placement of service
orders within the limitations of a task order and the contract; however, the decision to use a service
order is optional and at the discretion of the OCO. Service orders do not need to be issued if all details
required to initiate service are provided in the task order 6. If needed, service orders can be used to
authorize the start, change, or discontinuation of services. Service orders can also be used to modify
previously issued service orders. Service orders may be issued to provide the contractor with full details
of the delivery requirements for the agency-specific services. The basic circuit design information for all
new or changed circuits can be provided by the service order. The service order can also be used to
procure specific devices and ancillary equipment necessary to install the circuit or services designated.
Multiple service orders may be issued against a single task
order. If the agency intends to place service orders

delegated by the OCO. 7 CORs replace the Designated Agency Representative (DAR) role
performed under Networx and WITS. CORs may place service orders, accept or reject services,
verify that services meet technical requirements, confirm task order funding, and execute other
duties delegated by the OCO. The COR may not bind the government by obligating funds or by
issuing or modifying task orders.

5.2

Modify Task Order

The OCO may at any time, by written order, make changes that are within the general scope of the task
order. Modifications are executed in accordance with FAR Part 43 and the agency supplement. The OCO
has overall responsibility for administering the task order. The right to change the terms and conditions
of the task order, terminate the task order, and exercise task order options is reserved solely for the
OCO. When the contractor initiates the modification request, the OCO shall review modification
requests that add or change existing services to ensure it is technically sufficient and proposed pricing is
fair and reasonable. After determining the contractor’s proposal is acceptable, the OCO and the
contractor sign an SF-30, if required. Task order-specific modifications proposed by a contractor to an
OCO shall follow these guidelines and shall generally adhere to the requirements for contrac
modification submissions set out in FAR Part 43.

5.3

Manage Disputes and Terminations

The EIS contracts have Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements along with an SLA credit
management methodology to address failed SLAs. GSA has incorporated these SLA requirements and
he associated management methodology into the Conexus system to assist agencies with the resolution
of SLA-related issues. For other unresolved issues under the task order between the agency and
contractor, GSA recommends that agencies use available task order remedies including but not limited
o: reporting negative contractor performance in CPARS; issuing show cause and cure notices; and
initiating task order terminations. Agencies should refer to the FAR and agency supplement before
initiating these actions. For more information on performance disputes related to EIS, please refer to
he requirements of Section G.4.4 [Disputes] of the EIS contracts and the Management and Operations
Handbook.

5.4

Close-Out Task Order

When the period of performance of the EIS contracts has ended the task order must be closed. The OCO
is responsible to close out the task order. Close-out is to be performed according to FAR 4.804 and any
agency supplements.

7

The placement of service orders is considered an inherently governmental function and may only be performed
by an OCO or COR. Note however, that service orders may be prepared by others prior to the placement by the
OCO or COR.

Defining the Period of Performance of a TO

Background

As the total Period of Performance (POP) of an Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions
(EIS) contract is 15 years, agencies are seeking guidance on how to issue TOs tha
cover extended periods, up to the EIS contract end date.

Issue

Suggested Approach

•
•

The prices on the EIS contracts are definitized only for the awarded period
(currently the 5-year base period).
How can a TO POP that extends beyond the awarded period be accommodated?

1) The POP is determined by the agency. The agency may need to do a
Determination and Findings (D&F) justification.
2) The agency must request and evaluate pricing for the desired POP, including
unpriced contract years. It is important for the agency to be extremely clear in
he solicitation that this is the intent. Once options are priced and funding is
available, the agency may exercise the options without the need for another FO.
3) The agency should include language in the solicitation that ties to the Economic
Price Adjustment - Price Refreshment clause in Section H.19 of the EIS contract.
Price refreshment will take place in EIS contract years 5 and 10 and may result in
economically adjusted prices (EAPs). If the price refreshment results in pricing
lower than the CLIN price, the CLIN price should be decreased to match the EAP.
4) In accordance with FAR 17.207, the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) should
assess option year pricing to ensure it continues to be fair and reasonable in the
out-years. If market pricing is better than available pricing plus any costs of
disrupting continuity of service, the OCO may decide to renegotiate contrac
pricing or conduct a new FO.
5) If the agency’s regulations and policies allow the TO to extend beyond five years,
hat agency may award a longer POP using priced options. However, an EIS TO’s

Multiple TOs from a Single FO Solicitation
•
•

Background

•
•
•

Issue

An agency desires to include all data and voice services into a single solicitation
o streamline the FO process to one acquisition that includes all requirements.
The agency contemplates awarding data and voice services to a single contractor
but also wants the option to award data to one contractor and voice to another
should the proposals indicate a particular contractors’ strengths and/or pricing
advantages.
The agency wishes to award TOs on a bureau/component basis so these
organizations can administer their services to best meet mission requirements.
The agency wants to use one solicitation to select multiple contractors for the
same requirements: such as for a primary and backup, or for network
redundancy/diversity.
The agency may also wish to select multiple voice providers based on their
relative strengths in different geographic areas.

How can agencies best write their solicitations to retain flexibility on the number of
TO awards that are eventually made?
Section B, Pricing, should include as part of the introductory and background material
a clear description of the agency’s intent to separate voice and data pricing or define
pricing by geographic area so that they can be evaluated separately.
Section C, Statement of Work, should include as part of the introductory and
background material a clear description of the agency’s intent to separate voice and
data requirements or define voice requirements by geographic area so that they can
be evaluated separately.
Section J, Attachments, should include separate artifacts for voice and data to
maintain independence between the two categories of requirements. This would
include pricing submission artifacts, as well as other attachments related to technical
requirements.

Suggested Approach

Section L, Instructions to Offerors, should include any pricing and proposal
development instructions related to preparing the separate voice and data responses.
Section M, Evaluation Criteria, should describe how the agency will evaluate
responses and indicate that either a single award or multiple awards could result. The
OCO should consult agency regulations and policies as well as the FAR.
If the agency plans to award to multiple contractors, the OCO should clearly specify
which requirements apply to each awardee. Consultation with the agency legal
department is advised.
Other Suggestions:
Consider having one OCO responsible for awarding all the TOs to provide consistency
and streamline the decision process.

Use Case Name

TO Funding using Bureau 9 Codes
An agency desires to include multiple services or services for multiple bureaus into a
single FO.

Background

•
•

Issue

The agency PMO is comfortable managing TO funding for centrally-managed
services but is uncomfortable managing TO funding for services that have
previously been managed directly by bureaus.
The agency is comfortable with making a single award and issuing a single TO bu
may need to fund the TO from multiple funding sources. The agency needs to
ensure that the TO is properly funded and managed.

Is it permissible under EIS to fund a TO from multiple funding sources such as from
various bureaus?
TOs may contain multiple accounting and appropriation codes, one for each of the
line items or categories of line items being funded by that source.
This allows an agency to fund the TO from multiple sources, e.g., department,
bureau, and sub-bureau levels.
•

Suggested Approach

•

A sub-TO funding bucket can be established to be monitored and managed
by the agency PMO for centrally-managed services.
Individual sub-TO funding buckets can be established to be monitored and
managed separately by bureaus.

Agency Hierarchy Codes (AHCs) are a tool that can be used to manage sub-TO funding
buckets. Under EIS, the AHCs are pass-through and EIS contractors will not be
validating or managing these codes. The design, development, and management of
AHCs for line-of-accounting requirements are the agency’s responsibility.
Note: If the above approach is not viable due to agency regulations or accounting
practices, the agency may need to issue one TO for centrally-managed services and
separate TOs for each bureau’s directly-managed services.

Accommodating Expected Moves, Adds, Changes and Additional Quantities
of Services or Additional Services in EIS Solicitations
From EIS Contracting Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What are acceptable methods for producing a FO solicitation that takes into accoun
he expected and largely routine moves, adds, changes, and natural network growth
over the TO period of performance?

Background

Answer: FAR 16.505(a)(2) states in part that “Individual orders shall clearly describe
all services to be performed or supplies to be delivered so the full price for the
performance of the work can be established when the order is placed.” Ordering
entities may use options to include additional services, locations, or quantities. Priced
options or Optional CLINs need to be included in your solicitation when it is released.
They must be priced, evaluated and included in your Total Evaluated Price in order to
be exercised in accordance with FAR Part 17.2. Using Optional CLINs avoids the need
for an agency to conduct a new fair opportunity or take an exception to fair
opportunity. Optional CLINs represent a legitimate need based on such things as
potential future requirements, forecasted data and estimated quantities but are
ordered if and when the agency chooses to do so.
They may also define a dynamic requirement (i.e., inclusive of moves, adds, and
changes) over the period of performance of the TO. A combination of both is also
allowable. The obligation of funds for options will occur when the options are
exercised.

Issue

Agencies need to have their FO solicitation and resulting TO(s) cover expected moves,
adds, changes, network/bandwidth growth, and optional services.
Agencies need to include language in their solicitations that covers options they
would like priced for expected services.
The following provides guidance and sample language (in italics) that can be adapted
by agencies to fit their particular needs.
[AGENCY] Section B. General Pricing and Coverage Requirements

Suggested Approach

Guidance: List all the Optional CLINs/Services/Locations/Quantities in Section B and
clearly label them as Optional.
Section B or J - Price Evaluation Tables. If an agency includes a price evaluation table
in its solicitation, create a tab in the spreadsheet for the Mandatory requirement and
a separate Tab for the Optional CLINs/Services/Locations/Quantities so that offerors
can price them.
In addition to the mandatory requirement, for evaluation purposes, [AGENCY] has
created a list of all Optional CLINs, locations, and quantities based on a forecast of the

28
v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

Section

Description

expected demand for service additions, changes, and other anticipated network
changes to be acquired under this Task Order (TO). These estimated quantities are
included in the price evaluation tables found in Section J. The Offeror shall price all
Optional CLINs, locations, and quantities identified in the list for the time periods
specified.
The quantities contained in the tables found in Section J.x are not a guarantee of
future requirements: actual quantities may vary during the performance period.
Further, [AGENCY] is not required to exercise and/or order any CLINs/quantities of
services included in any priced options. If [Agency] does choose to exercise one or
more of the priced options, it is not required to order any of the services included in
he associated CLINs, but it may order a quantity between one and the maximum
cumulative estimated quantity stated over the TO period of performance.
For new requirements, the Offeror shall propose pricing consistent with the pricing
and discounting used to award the original TO.
As indicated in TO Section C.x and Optional CLIN x, [AGENCY] expects up to 200 office
locations changing per year, or 2,000 over the 10-year period of performance of the
TO. If the Offeror chooses to assign new [AGENCY] building NSCs to existing PHubs,
[AGENCY] will evaluate whether the assignments result in fair and reasonable prices
for access arrangements. The Contractor shall submit an EIS contract modification
with the new NSC to PHub mapping so that GSA can determine if the resulting prices
are fair and reasonable. If the Offeror chooses to assign a new [AGENCY] building NSC
o a new PHub, the Offeror shall first submit an EIS contract modification to add the
new PHub to the EIS contract. The resulting price(s) may then be added to the TO via a
TO modification.
The Offeror shall price the TO periods defined in Table B.x. The Offeror need no
populate a price table with a separate row for each TO year if the prices do not vary by
TO year. Any TO pricing that extends beyond the end of the current EIS contract period
shall be no higher than the economically adjusted prices negotiated for the nex
contract option period, as described in Clause H.19 of the EIS contract (see guidance
for a clause in H).
[AGENCY] Section C. Project Scope states: Guidance: Include descriptions of the
Optional CLINs/Services/Locations/Quantities and clearly label them as Optional.
The TO will provide service to all existing [AGENCY] locations as well as any future sites
as they become known. [AGENCY] anticipates up to 200 location changes each year.
Moves to new locations as well as changes, additions, or deletions of service are
necessary to provide [AGENCY] with the continuity of service required to fulfill its
mission.
[AGENCY] Section H.x Special Contract Requirements: Exercising Priced Optional CLINs
Create a clause that allows you to execute the Optional CLINs. The prescription in the
FAR for using FAR Clause 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity—Separately Priced
Line Item states that it may be used for other than services but an agency may want to
consider modifying the language to make it applicable to services and remove clause
citation and rename it, e.g., Clause H.1 Ordering Optional

Section

Description

CLINs/Services/Locations/Quantities - Separately Priced Line Item.
[AGENCY] Section H.x Special Contract Requirements: Price Extension
All new price submissions shall be compliant with Section J.4.1 of the EIS contrac
which stipulates that a TO-specific price for a non-ICB CLIN must be no higher than the
corresponding contract price if the service is identical. [AGENCY] will evaluate the
proposed pricing to determine if it is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the
agency. If the determination is favorable, the OCO will issue a modification to the TO
o incorporate the agreed upon prices by reference and exercise the applicable option.
If the determination is unfavorable, [AGENCY] reserves the right to conduct a new Fair
Opportunity procurement (FAR Part 16.505) for the aforementioned option.
The EIS contract includes a clause in Section H.19 that requires contractors to refresh
contract prices prior to GSA exercising Option Period 1 in FY22 and Option Period 2 in
FY28. Subsequent price reductions on the contractor’s EIS contract shall reduce prices
prospectively on this awarded TO from the effective date of the EIS contract price
reduction modification. The contractor is required to notify the OCO, in writing, within
30 days of the executed modifications on the EIS contract to reduce prices per clause
H.19. Notification shall include a copy of EIS SF30 and a list of effective CLINs affected
by price reduction and request for the downward adjustment to the TO price.
[AGENCY] Section L:
Note: Section L should include specific instructions regarding what must be priced,
i.e., all CLINs associated with mandatory requirements and optional CLINs for the base
year and all option years.
[AGENCY] Section M:
Guidance: Include language for evaluating Optional
CLINs/Services/Locations/Quantities and state that the proposed prices will be
included in the Total Evaluated Price. This complies with FAR Part 17.2
Instructions for identifying and pricing CLINs for the base period and all option years
are identified in Section L. The OCO will evaluate all CLIN prices, as proposed by each
offeror. Calculation of each Offeror’s total evaluated price will consist of the sum of all
prices proposed for all CLINs required to be priced multiplied by corresponding
projected quantities, inclusive of all priced options.

Solicitations that include Diverse, Redundant or Back-up Services from a
Single Provider

Background

Issue

For Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuity of Operations (COOP), the EIS contracts
offer multiple services, including:
Access solutions that use a combination of different services; e.g., wireline and
wireless access.
Agency wants to award diverse, redundant or back-up services as part of a single
solicitation to a single provider. This can be accomplished through diverse paths from
a single EIS contractor.
In the solicitation:
•

Section B:
• Provide pricing instructions for access diversity that specify these
services are to be priced individually.
• Instructions for pricing access arrangements should include how special
access construction pricing can, or cannot, be applied.

•

Section C: Define technical requirements so that both primary and secondary
services are listed separately and are described in detail.
• Detail mandatory requirements including the level of diversity, as well as
any optional requirements (for example: fully diverse with x feet of
separation, collapsed infrastructure with both circuits using the same
path, etc.). When construction is required to meet the requirements,
his must be researched by the contractors and priced on a site-specific
basis; therefore, the agency should allow sufficient time during proposal
preparation for this process.
• Requirements should include the level of detail (down to street-level
drawings) that must be provided.
• Requirements should be described in a way that will solicit a response
hat defines and commits the contractor to its process to maintain
diversity. The agency must be aware that providers regularly “groom”
network services to achieve the most efficient or cost-effective route.
This process can “groom away” diversity that has been established.
Therefore, it is critically important that the solicitation include a
requirement to describe a process that will ensure that diversity is
maintained.

•

Section L:
• For Individual Case Basis (ICB) Access Arrangements: require the
contractors to augment descriptions with all relevant information to
define diversity, avoidance, or other customization of the circuit.
• Proposal instructions should direct contractors to provide

Transitioning to a Managed Network Solution under EIS

Background

The agency currently owns and operates telecommunications and networking
equipment (e.g. routers, switches, channel banks) and desires to transition to a
managed services solution under EIS. The agency views the migration to a managed
service model proceeding in two phases. With the first phase, current governmen
owned equipment will be furnished to the vendor and managed/operated through
end of life. Under the second phase, new equipment will be implemented, owned,
and operated by the vendor – providing the agency a fully managed solution.

Issue

How can migration to a managed network solution be accomplished under EIS?
EIS provides for managed service solutions, as described in Section C.2.8.1 [Managed
Network Service]:
Managed Network Service (MNS) enables an agency to obtain design and engineering,
implementation, management, and maintenance services for agency networks. MNS
provides the necessary technical and operational capabilities that ensure the
availability and reliability of agencies’ increasingly complex networks.
The contractor shall use the appropriate labor and equipment as defined in Section
C.2.10 [Service Related Equipment] and Section C.2.11 [Service Related Labor] in the
TO.
Under the MNS offering, the contractor provides overall management of an agency’s
network infrastructure, including real-time proactive network monitoring,
roubleshooting and service restoration. The contractor is the agency’s single point of
accountability for all networks managed under this service, including operations,
maintenance, and administration activities.

Suggested Approach

In phase 1, the agency provides the vendor existing network infrastructure as
Government Furnished Property (GFP). Per Section C.2.8.1.2 [MNS Features], the
vendor operates and maintains the GFP based on performance metrics / SLAs
established in the TO. In phase 2 at end-of-GFP-life, the vendor replaces the agency’s
network infrastructure as vendor-owned Service Related Equipment (SRE). The
vendor continues to operate and maintain infrastructure during phase 2 based on the
established performance metrics / SLAs.
GSA offers the following technical and pricing considerations to successfully
accomplish fair opportunity and structure the TO.
Technical Considerations:
Define agency requirements as a Performance Work Statement (PWS) as follows:
•

Establish the scope of services based on tailored elements of Section C.2.8.1
[Managed Network Service].

•

Define specific performance levels, metrics, and SLAs for managed services at
he equipment and network levels for phase 1 and phase 2. Alternatively, the

35

Section

Description

agency may instruct offerors to propose performance standards.

•

Require offerors to propose a phase 1 to phase 2 migration plan.

•

Define (or require offerors to propose) a mechanism to determine phase 1 end
of life. Alternatively, define (or require offerors to propose) a specific period of
performance for phase 1.

•

Provide in the solicitation detailed inventory of site infrastructure equivalent to
he equipment parameters identified in Section B.2.10.2.1 [SRE Catalog –
Product Specification Table] of the EIS contracts.

Include provisions for a pre-award site survey for all offerors.
Pricing and Task Order Unique CLIN (TUC) Considerations:
Price phase 1 and 2 with fixed prices:
•

Structure the TO with phase 1 / year 1 as the base period. Price subsequent
years as options. Maximize the TO period of performance based on the
network life expectancy.

•

Consider using existing ICB Contract CLINs for GFP maintenance

•

Consider using TUCs to price non-recurring charges (NRCs) and monthly
recurring charges (MRCs) based on one of the following approaches:

•

o

Bundled on a network-wide basis.

o

Bundled on a site-by-site basis.

o

Unbundled on an equipment basis.

If priced on a site basis, consider categorizing sites by type based on size or
other relevant characteristic – and require offerors to propose prices by site
ype.

Include option to purchase infrastructure/SREs based on established terms and
conditions per Section B.2.10.8 [Government Option to Assume Ownership].

Appendix D: Functional Specification – Multiple Transition Options
In some cases, agencies may choose to solicit multiple proposals from industry regarding the following:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

Network technology
Ease of transition including speed
Improved performance
Best value pricing
Contract administration efficiencies
And others

One example of allowing industry to provide multiple options for a network transition and/or
ransformation is the following:
Agency can provide in the RFI or solicitation the current network configuration with inventories and
locations. This should include performance standards that are currently in place under the agency’s
Networx contract such as:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)
g)

Type of network technology currently in use e.g. private line, TDM, MPLS, hybrid, etc.
Bandwidth by location
Network availability
Reliability
Throughput if appropriate with measurements
Repair times
Any other significant measurement of performance

With the current network configuration and inventories, offerors should be instructed to provide either
a like-for-like, or a new technology, or both. New technology should be compared to the curren
performance measurements to show the effect with a new network. Additionally, any new performance
measurements can be detailed in the providers’ proposal. This allows offerors to provide either the
same like-for-like transition or the benefits of a newer technology. For example, the agency could detail
its traditional TDM voice solution with numerous locations throughout the country. However, the
solicitation will state that the offeror can provide the same solution or a new technology, such as VoIP.
This has been routinely stated as a functional or performance specification. It is imperative that the
agency list its performance measurements for the TDM solution so that a new technology can be
measured against the current configuration. This will allow the agency to do a trade-off analysis to
determine best value.
Another example is for agency data requirements. Assume that the agency has a MPLS virtual private
network throughout the world. The agency lists its current performance measurements. Offerors are
instructed to provide either the same technology (like-for-like) or another technology, such as Ethernet.
38
v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

If, in this example, Ethernet is proposed, the proposal must clearly state the difference in performance
from the existing network to an Ethernet solution.
Agencies should use evaluation factors to establish its priority for evaluation. For example, ease of
ransition can be a prime factor for an agency that needs to transition quickly. Or an increase in
bandwidth may be more important for another agency. Obviously, price will always be a major
consideration. Also, a hybrid technology approach may be called for at different locations, e.g. remote
locations. Again, industry can leverage the best technology approach for a given situation. One size may
not fit all.
This functional, performance-based approach will allow agencies to decide on the best option
availability from EIS providers. This should also significantly increase competition with the use of
multiple proposals. This is not the only way to achieve the optimum solution. However, it allows the
agencies to see the difference between the current solution and a new technology. Agencies may
already have a newer technology so a like-for-like transition can still be achieved with this approach.
Flexibility is paramount for the agency decision makers.

Appendix E: Frequently Asked Questions
What are the benefits of having task orders?
How many years can a task order's period of performance last under EIS?
What are acceptable methods for producing a Fair Opportunity solicitation that takes into account the
potential of future services that cannot at this time be forecasted for quantity and geography?
What arrangements have been made for the transfer of service enabling devices (SEDs) from the legacy
contracts to EIS?
Visit EIS Resources for more FAQs.
What are the benefits of having task orders?
Answer: Task orders provide a formal contractual relationship between an ordering entity and the
contractor. Contracts require the following elements: a) an offer; b) an acceptance of that offer
which results in a meeting of the minds; c) a promise to perform; d) a valuable consideration (which
can be a promise or payment in some form); e) a time or event when performance must be made
(meet commitments); f) terms and conditions for performance, including fulfilling promises; g)
performance.
Should there be some type of performance issue during the period of performance of the task order,
he ordering entity can enforce the terms of the contract (i.e. service level agreement credits) or can
erminate services under FAR 52.249-8 Default [Fixed-Price Supply and Service] or a special agency
clause for the cancellation or termination of orders under communication service contracts with
common carriers in accordance with FAR 49.505(c).
How many years can a task order's period of performance last under EIS?
Answer: FAR 16.505 does not prescribe a timeframe for period of performance for task orders
other than a five-year limit on task orders for advisory and assistance services. Agencies should
review their FAR supplement for additional agency-specific guidance.
FAR 17.204(e) states:
”Unless otherwise approved in accordance with agency procedures, the total of the basic and
option periods shall not exceed 5 years in the case of services, and the total of the basic and
option quantities shall not exceed the requirement for 5 years in the case of supplies. These
limitations do not apply to information technology contracts. However, statutes applicable to
various classes of contracts, for example, the Contract Labor Standards statute (see 22.10021), may place additional restrictions on the length of contracts.”
The Product Service Code (PSC) used for reporting information in Federal Procurement Data System
(FPDS) combines Information Technology and Telecommunications in Category D. The agency
40
v.5.2, October 15, 2019

Fair Opportunity and Ordering Guide

should verify whether its organization considers telecommunications to be IT.
If
elecommunications is not considered IT, the agency should follow the agency procedures for
exceeding the 5-year limit.
What are acceptable methods for structuring a Fair Opportunity solicitation that takes into accoun
he potential of future services that cannot at this time be forecasted for quantity and geography?
Answer: FAR 16.505(a)(2) states in part that “[i]ndividual orders shall clearly describe all services to
be performed or supplies to be delivered so the full cost or price for the performance of the work
can be established when the order is placed.” Ordering entities may use priced options to include
additional services, locations, or quantities. They may also define a dynamic requirement (inclusive
of adds, moves, and changes) over the period of performance of the task order. A combination of
both is also allowable.
GSA believes that a task order with all the elements required in FAR 16.505(a)(7) could be awarded
with a ceiling price if the requirement is described to allow for flexibility in the quantity of services.
Because the requirement includes a maximum quantity, the quantity is not indefinite and therefore
not an IDIQ under an IDIQ. For example, an agency may need up to 1000 IPVS (VOIP) lines in
Washington, DC during the period of performance of the task order. The task order would include
an obligation to cover all 1000 IPVS circuits. At task order award, the agency has 800 existing lines
o be installed immediately. The remaining may be installed throughout the period of performance
of the task order as long as the remaining 200 lines were priced and evaluated as part of the initial
award.
What arrangements have been made for the transfer of service enabling devices (SEDs) from the
legacy contracts to EIS?
Answer: The GSA Networx contracts allow agencies the option to assume title or ownership of
Service Enabling Devices (SEDs) as stated:
“B.4.8.4 Government Option to Assume Ownership. The Government may, at its sole
discretion, following payment of the DNRC or at completion of the DMRC payment term,
assume ownership of the SED(s), as described in Section H.23. Where the Government has
assumed ownership of a SED, the user will have the option to continue receiving maintenance
from the contractor. In this case, the contractor shall provide the same level of maintenance a
he MMRC established for the former SED when it was contractor-owned. This continued
support capability following a change in ownership is subject to the same termination of suppor
provision provided for in B.4.8.3.”
The EIS contracts allow agencies to require service providers to manage government-furnished
property (GFP). GSA recommends that requirements for maintenance of GFP be included in the Fair
Opportunity solicitation and allow the EIS contractors to propose their best solution. One possible
solution is to use EIS CLIN MN50001 for GFP maintenance, analogous to Networx MNS CLIN 289001
for GFE maintenance, see Table B.2.8.1.5.2 [MNS Feature Pricing Instructions] of the EIS contracts.
