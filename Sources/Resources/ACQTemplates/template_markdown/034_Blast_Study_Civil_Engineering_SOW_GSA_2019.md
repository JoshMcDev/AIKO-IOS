U.S. General Services Administration

GSA’s Government-wide
Strategic Solutions
(GSS) Program
Learn about the Benefits
GSA can help your agency shorten procurement cycles, ensure compliance, and get the best value on more
han 7.5 million innovative IT products, services, and solutions from over 4,600 pre-vetted vendors. Our industry
partners offer IT products, services, and solutions at the best prices. As part of the Government-wide Strategic
Solutions (GSS) for Desktops and Laptops initiative, GSA offers online purchasing tools for federal agencies to
purchase standard desktop and laptop configurations through the IT category on GSA Schedule.

What are the Benefits and Features of GSA’s GSS Program/BPAs?
• The GSS Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)

allow all government agencies to buy pre-configured
laptops, desktops, tablets, and monitors with option
upgrades and services with a faster, more-efficien
business model that provides cost savings for the
government with next-generation technology
customer-service capabilities without additional
procurement requirements.

• Single-award BPAs include brand-name or equal

laptops and desktops that meet current GSS standard
configurations.

• Fully pre-competed desktop and laptop products

are available for immediate purchase with no further
competition required. There is no need to do a
Request for Quotation (RFQ) or get three bids. You
can place any size order, quickly and easily.

BPA structure:

• Acquisition strategy for BPA: competitive
small-business set-aside

• Solicitation method: GSA eBuy
• Evaluation method: lowest price
echnically acceptable

• Set-aside: yes
• Quotations received: 16
• GSA Schedule – IT category
• Access to all (in-scope) options and

accessories on the BPA-holder GSA contract*

*Options must be purchased in conjunction
with a base BPA configuration.

• GSA AdvantageSelect!SM simplifies GSS buying by

utilizing our latest procurement tools to do the
“heavy lifting” for customers. A buyer simply selects
an item, enters the quantity, and pays for the order
– without worrying about managing an extended
competitive process.

OMB named the IT category
on GSA Schedule “Best-inClass” for software, hardware,
and GSS desktops and laptops.

Why Use GSA’s GSS Program Instead of Your Agency BPA for Laptops and Desktops?
1. No brand-name J&A required

• The ordering procedures for these four single-

award BPAs are found in FAR 8.405-3(c)(1).
Agencies are not required to do a brand-name
justification and approval (J&A) because this
procurement was conducted as a brand name or
equal. Based on the responses received for each
of the four original equipment manufacturers
(Dell™, HP®, Microsoft®, and Lenovo®), four
single-award BPAs were awarded to capture the
full breadth of products for our GSA
AdvantageSelect! catalog.

2. Full breadth of products

• All Dell, HP, Microsoft®, and Lenovo models

meeting the GSS standard configurations are
available through the awarded BPAs. If you
have agency-specific needs, you can modify the
configurations using the OMB-approved GSS
options and accessories.

3. Discounted pricing

• Additional discounts can be negotiated based on
