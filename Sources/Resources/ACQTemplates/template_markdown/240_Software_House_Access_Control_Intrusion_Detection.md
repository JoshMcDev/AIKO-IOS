shorts, opens and grounds.
v. Request to Exit (REX)
1. The resistor for the REX shall be installed inside the device
where applicable.
2. The circuits shall be line supervised and shall annunciate for
shorts, opens and grounds.
vi. HID Access Control Readers, control boxes (12X14), Request to Exi

wired as a single point of alarm.
iv. The circuits shall be line supervised and shall annunciate for shorts,
opens and grounds.
H. TAMPERS

i. See the general requirements for additional information.
ii. All IDS keypad mounting shall have a tamper device either optical or
mechanical. (A tamper alarm shall be generated if the box is removed
from the wall and/or the keypad cover is removed.) If two separate
switches are utilized, both tampers shall be installed in series as one
circuit.
I. GLASS BREAKS
i. The SC shall provide for minor deviations or relocation of sensors as
required. When changes require only a minimal amount of work (1 hour
labor) and/or materials, there shall be no additional cost to the Client.
ii. Glass Breaks shall be installed and adjusted to initiate an alarm condition
when a window is broken within the area of coverage.
iii. The circuits shall be line supervised and shall annunciate for shorts,
opens and grounds.
