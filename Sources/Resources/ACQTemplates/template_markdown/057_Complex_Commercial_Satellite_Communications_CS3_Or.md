1.11.3 The establishment of a BPA does not guarantee any future order award.
1.11.4 This BPA has On/Off Ramp procedures for the purpose of adding new 03FAC MAS Schedule
Contractors to the existing BPA to perform recurring medical facilities O&M services, if needed.
Schedule Contractors may be Off-Ramped for various reasons, such as, not actively participating in
competitions, a documented trend of unacceptable or deficient performance issues, lack of cos
control measures or labor efficiency and/or not adhering to the terms and conditions of the BPA
and/or order.
1.11.4.1 At the discretion of the CO, the On-Ramp procedures may be implemented at any time prior
or after the renewal period, with other 03 FAC Schedule Contractors if a contractor is being OffRamped or when renewal option is not exercised. This On-Ramp will be conducted by reopening the
competition through the issuance of a RFQ and utilizing the same evaluation criteria/process specified
in this initial RFQ para 2.0. Any resulting new additional BPA awards will coincide with the remaining
BPA PoP and will have the terms and conditions of the established BPA at the time of quote
submission.
1.11.4.2 Only 03FAC MAS Schedule Contractors that are not a BPA Holder at the time of the OnRamp opportunity may be considered. Any BPA holder who was Off-Ramped or whose BPA was no
renewed will not be eligible for any future On-Ramp opportunity for 3-years after being Off-Ramped.
1.11.4.3 The total number of established BPA Schedule Contractors at award will be the standard
unless a BPA Schedule Contractor is being Off-Ramped. If a BPA Schedule Contractor is being OffRamped the standard will be exceeded by the number of BPA Schedule Contractors being OffRamped for the shortest duration possible to allow for the acquisition process. FAR 52.237-3,
Continuity of Services is included in this RFQ.
1.12 Organizational Conflict of Interes
In accordance with FAR Part 9.5, the Schedule Contractors shall identify any potential conflict of
interest with their RFQ submission.

year that are currently being performed or were completed not more than five (5) years prior to the
issue date of this RFQ. These submissions must be at least one (1) hospital and one (1) laboratory

successful performance. Past performance records demonstrating better than satisfactory pas
performance and/or exceeding the definition of similar may be rated more favorably.
2.3 Pricing
This BPA and the two initial site orders contain multiple payment arrangements, Firm Fixed Price
(FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M), as specified in the pricing schedule on each contract line item
number (CLIN). Firm Fixed Price (FFP) is used for the following categories: Preventative Maintenance

(Attachments 7 and 8), the Schedule Contractor must specify the discount in the Pricing Volume.
The Schedule Contractors are responsible for ensuring the formulas are accurately computed and
shall utilize the format provided. Do not modify the Government’s format for quote submission.
Pricing will be evaluated to determine whether the level of effort and labor mix are sufficient to perform
he requirements of the PWS.
The base year pricing amount and each option year pricing amount, to include specified not-to-exceed
(NTE) amounts, will be totaled for a total price for each site to determine fair and reasonable pricing.
The price for site 1 and the price for site 2 Price will be added together for a Total evaluated price tha
