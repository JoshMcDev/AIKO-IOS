Ordering Guide Overview
This ordering guide is intended to help ordering agencies, particularly contracting officers, effectively use
he Small Business GWACs to deliver best value. It is divided into three Parts:
Part I

– General Information, applicable to all of the current GSA Small Business GWACs,

Part II – GWAC Specific Information, and
Part III – Appendices
This Ordering Guide is not a stand-alone reference - it is recommended that the reader also become
familiar with the GWAC Contracts. This Ordering Guide may be revised from time to time. Updates to this
publication, when they occur, will be available online at http://www.gsa.gov/gwac.
Additional information available to assist ordering agencies in using the GWACs is available online a
http://www.gsa.gov/gwac; this site includes links to the individual GWAC websites where a copy of each
basic contract, an industry partner listing and other useful information can be found. Questions
concerning this guide should be directed to a GWAC Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) identified in
Part III - Appendix II.
This Ordering Guide refers to Orders and Task Orders interchangeably, both of which are defined by the
definition of task order in FAR 2.101, where task order means “an order for services placed against an
established contract or with Government sources.” Delivery orders as defined in FAR 2.101 are not within
he scope of GSA Small Business GWACs.

Part I – General Information
Introduction
The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Office of Information
Technology Category (ITC), Small Business Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) team (see
Appendix II) awarded and supports a diversified portfolio of pre-competed, multiple-award GWACs
awarded to small business firms encouraging their success and movement into unrestricted acquisition
environments. These industry partners specialize in providing innovative, information technology (IT)
services and IT services-based solutions to federal agencies worldwide. The GWACs managed by the
eam are 8(a) STARS II, 8(a) STARS III, Alliant Small Business and VETS 2.
Our goal is to streamline procuring IT Services for our federal customers through:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Access to high-quality industry partners
Pre-competed, multiple award contracts
Shortened procurement lead time
Limited protestability
Socioeconomic credit through FPDS-NG reporting
Customer-focused staff with expertise in small business technology contracts
Scope compatibility reviews of prospective orders and modifications
Market research and capabilities suppor
Identical labor categories for all industry partners on each contrac

Scope
A GWAC is defined as a task-order or delivery-order contract for information technology (IT) established
by one agency for governmentwide use that is operated by an executive agent designated by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 11302(e). GWACs were established pursuan
Section 5112(e) of the Clinger-Cohen Act and are not subject to the Economy Act.
In a June 6, 2008 memo, the OMB emphasized the numerous benefits interagency acquisitions have,
including: economies of scale, contract efficiencies, and leveraging resources. Small business GWACs
are in concert with OMB’s stated policy on interagency contracting. Ordering under an OMB approved
GWAC is presumed to be in the Government’s best interest.

Ordering from the Small Business GWACs
Access to the Small Business GWACs
Orders are awarded by warranted contracting officers who have received a written, GSA-issued
Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA), making them Ordering Contracting Officers (OCOs.) OCOs
can work for their own agency or on behalf of another, as described below:
1. Direct Acquisitions. Under this scenario, the customer agency is responsible for its own order
acquisition and program management activities.
2. Assisted Acquisitions. In this scenario, the customer agency elects to have an assisted acquisition
organization provide order acquisition and/or program management services. The scope and terms

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

U.S. General Services Administration

of the assisted acquisition support are coordinated between the customer agency and the assisted
acquisition organization agency.
NOTE: Agency contracting officers should follow agency policy regarding any additional justification
required, such as why the contract vehicle is best suited for the acquisition and the cost effectiveness
of the acquisition.

Eligible Ordering Activities
GSA Order OGP 4800.2I order provides definitions and listings of agencies and other activities authorized
o use GSA sources of supply and services. It also provides definitive guidelines concerning eligibility
requirements.
Organizations authorized in GSA Order OGP 4800.2I, may use the GWACs covered by this ordering
guide.
GSA Order OGP 4800.2I can be found at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104212

Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA)
Federal contracting officers who wish to issue or administer orders on a GSA Small Business GWAC
must receive applicable overview training and DPA, making them Ordering Contracting Officers
(OCOs.) The training provides an overview of key GWAC features, while the DPA establishes OCO &
GWAC PCO responsibilities. The DPA delineates between those OCO responsibilities derived from
he OCO’s warrant and those originating in the DPA itself.
It is a best practice for a DPA to be in place before a GWAC opportunity is competed1. A DPA is
required prior to issuing and administering orders. While a DPA can only be granted to warranted
federal contracting officers, all individuals on the acquisition team are encouraged to participate in
DPA training.
While failure to follow the DPA requirement is not a violation of law or regulation, it unnecessarily
increases procurement risk.

Overview Training
There are various ways to receive the DPA training:
1. Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Online Courses
Continuous Learning Point (CLP)-certified GSA GWAC courses are available at www.dau.mil.
You can select a specific GWAC course or the combined GSA GWACs' course:
•
•

FAC 071 GSA VETS 2 GWAC
FAC 087 GSA GWACs for IT Services-Based Solutions(8(a) STARS II, VETS 2
and Alliant 2)
2. Webinar, Teleconference, Video Teleconference

U.S. General Services Administration

To start the process of scheduling teleconference training, each contracting officer wanting
delegation must submit the following information to the sbgwac@gsa.gov:
1. Agency name, bureau/command name (if any), individual(s) full name, street address,
e-mail address, phone number and fax number, and
2. Names of other individuals who may be participating in the contract overview training
but not seeking delegation.
After receipt of this information, a GSA associate will contact the requestor(s) to schedule the
overview training. This training will take approximately one hour and may offer CLP credit.
3. On-site for Large Groups of Contracting Officers and IT Program Officials
Please contact the Small Business GWAC Division for details at sbgwac@gsa.gov or
(877)327-8732.
4. Review of Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide
A thorough review and understanding of the Small Business GWAC ordering guide will also
satisfy the training requirement. A current version of the Small Business ordering guide can be
found at www.gsa.gov/gwac. Since the ordering guide is subject to change, please check back
periodically for updates.
5. YouTube Training (8(a) STARS III or VETS 2)
8(a) STARS III: This self-paced video series allows contracting officers to familiarize
hemselves with 8(a) STARS III ordering procedures and request a DPA after completing the
raining series. This training provides flexibility as it allows contracting officers an independent,
self-paced method of learning. The 8(a) STARS III DPA training may be accessed a
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvdwyPgXnxxWTbU15qsbxSIH9OyYTQY3s or from
he GWAC Training webpage (www.gsa.gov/gwacdpa).
VETS 2: This self-paced video allows contracting officers to familiarize themselves with VETS
2 ordering procedures and request a DPA after completing the training video. The VETS 2
DPA training maybe accessed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-jLVzi48I or from the
GWAC Training webpage (www.gsa.gov/gwacdpa).

Requesting a DPA
Once the overview training has been completed, the final step is to request a DPA. To initiate the
request, please visit the Delegation of Procurement Authority section of the website found a
www.gsa.gov/gwacdpa, complete and submit the DPA Request Form. A GSA representative will
ypically respond within 24 hours.

DPA Portability
Should an OCO change US federal agencies the DPA does not transfer. In that circumstance the OCO
should e-mail delegations@gsa.gov to request a new DPA be issued reflecting the OCO’s new
organization. Retaking the overview training is not required.

If an OCO leaves federal employment or a task order is reassigned, the OCO should e-mail
delegations@gsa.gov to inform GSA. In that notice it would be helpful, when known, to identify the
successor OCO.

Order Types
Authorized order types2 available under the Small Business GWACs are:
1. Fixed-Price Family (FAR 16.2)
2. Time & Materials (FAR 16.6)
3. Labor Hour (FAR 16.6)
4. Cost-Reimbursement (FAR 16.3) Not available on 8(a) STARS III
5. Hybrid blends of the above types
6. Incentives tied to the above order types (FAR 16.4)

Time & Materials and Labor Hour
If not using Fixed-Price Order Type, FAR 16.601(d)(1) requires contracting officers to document the
rationale which applies to other Order Types. The determination and findings required by FAR
16.601(d)(1)(ii) requires a higher level of review - please check agency guidance for the required level
of review and approval.

Hybrid Blends
Some orders may have work containing a combination of contract types (e.g., Fixed-Price, Time &
Materials and Labor Hour). The OCO is responsible for identifying the applicable order type(s) and
making the order terms clear within the RFQ/RFP and resulting order.

Incentive
The OCO must evaluate and determine the appropriateness of all incentive terms, develop a
surveillance plan to implement and monitor an Award-Fee, Incentive-Fee, or Award-Term results in
accordance with FAR 15.4 and FAR 16.4.

Cost-Reimbursement
NOTE: The Cost-Reimbursement section applies to Alliant Small Business and VETS 2. Costreimbursement task orders are not allowed on 8(a) STARS II or 8(a) STARS III.
Cost reimbursement (CR) contracting is a highly specialized area necessitating the OCO and the
ordering agency to address the gamut of responsibilities associated therewith.
Because CR contracts provide industry partners with no direct incentive to control costs,
implementation should be carefully planned and managed. OCOs should consider the risks assumed
by the government as a result of using CR contracts and document both 1) those risks and 2) how they
will be mitigated and managed.

2

See FAR 16.104 for factors in selecting contract types

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

10

U.S. General Services Administration

OCOs should determine the adequacy of the government resources to properly plan for and administer
a CR procurement and identify action plans to minimize the use of other than firm fixed-price contracts
on future acquisitions for the same requirement [See, for instance, FAR 16.103(d)(1) and FAR 16.3013(a)(4)]
A cost reimbursement contract may be used only when
1. FAR 16.104 and FAR 16.301-3 have been addressed, and
2. A written acquisition plan has been approved at the applicable level, in which FAR
16.103(d)(1) should be addressed.

Contractor Cost Accounting Systems
OCOs should not assume all industry partners currently possess an adequate cost accounting
system. OCOs can explore which industry partners have adequate cost accounting systems through
market research before a task order request is issued.
OCOs must verify the adequacy of an industry partner’s cost accounting system prior to awarding any
cost reimbursement task order.
Reference the specific contract sections below for additional information on Industry Partner Cos
Accounting Systems.

Cost Evaluation
The OCO must determine cost allowability, allocability and realism, and also must analyze and
negotiate fee for all CR orders. Refer to FAR 15.305(a)(1), FAR 15.404-1 and FAR 16.3.

Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRA)
FPRA and provisional billing rates (PBR) are not maintained by the GWAC contracting officer.
Requests for existing FPRA and/or PBR may be made by the OCO of the industry partners. It is
ypical for OCOs to require industry partners to build their cost proposals using their latest FPRA or
PBR, whichever is most current, and to provide evidence from a cognizant auditing agency/activity.
OCOs may work with cognizant auditing agencies/activities for new FPRA and/or PBR.

Incurred Cost Audits
As mentioned above, OCOs and ordering agencies are responsible for the gamut of cos
reimbursement contracting responsibilities, including incurred cost audits and for reconciling those
results with applicable PBR or FPRA.

Order Process
The OCO is responsible for acquisition planning and conducting due diligence. The process to award a
ask order can be configured to agency needs, provided it is consistent with the terms and conditions of
he GWAC, customer agency policy, and the ordering procedures at FAR 16.505.

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

11

U.S. General Services Administration

It is recommended that OCOs keep submission requirements to the necessary minimum to promote
competition. Once a DPA is granted, the OCO follows their internal process for planning, funding the
requirement, gaining any necessary approvals and documenting the Order.
The Order process may be represented in seven steps:

Step 1: Plan the Acquisition
Per FAR 16.505 (a)(8), orders issued under a task order or delivery order contract awarded by another
agency (i.e., a GWAC or multi-agency contract) are not exempt from the development of acquisition
plans in accordance with FAR 7 and FAR 39. When developing the acquisition plan, the competition
requirements in FAR 6 and the policies in FAR 15.3 do not automatically apply to the ordering process.
FAR 16.505 instructs regarding task order source selection.
The total estimated life cycle value of a procurement including options should be considered in
developing an acquisition strategy. Tasks shall not be split to avoid threshold limitations. The basic task
and any modifications must stay within the GWAC’s and the Order’s scope.
In accordance with FAR 19.303(a)(2), the contracting officer shall select the NAICS (North
American Industry Classification System) code which best describes the principal purpose of the

product or service being acquired. A procurement is usually classified according to the
component which accounts for the greatest percentage of contract value.

Step 2: Define Requirement and Develop Task Order Request
Investing sufficient time and effort up front to write clear, high-quality requirements provides the
government a baseline for the development of other parts of the task order request, particularly the
evaluation criteria and proposal instructions. Clearly defined requirements facilitate a more accurate
Government estimate and more accurate budgeting. In addition, clearly defined requirements help
industry to better understand agency requirements and needs – thereby facilitating more accurate costs
or pricing and higher quality proposals. Potential post award benefits include minimizing the need for
change orders and modifications, better assessment criteria for measuring industry partner
performance, and reducing claims and disputes.

Performance Based Service Acquisition
Performance-Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) is an acquisition structured around the results to be
achieved as opposed to the manner by which the work is to be performed.
Pursuant to FAR 37.601, performance-based contracts for services shall include:
(1) A performance work statement (PWS);
(2) Measurable performance standards and the method of assessing contractor performance
against performance standards; and
(3) Performance incentives where appropriate.

Develop the Task Order Request
A task order request may be in the form of a RFP or RFQ and the OCO should be familiar with the
process differences associated with each. A task order request must include a work statement,

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

12

U.S. General Services Administration

evaluation factors suitable for the instant requirement, contract type, price or cost instructions, period
and place of performance, closing date/deadline, applicable instructions and other information (e.g.,
agency specific clauses, cyber-security requirements, etc.) applicable to the work effort.
Price or cost must be an evaluation factor for all task orders.
Evaluation factors other than price or cost should be limited to meaningful discriminators. In order to
reduce administrative costs and time for both the industry partner and government, it is a best practice
o provide clear instructions for proposal preparation and to keep submission requirements to the
necessary minimum. This facilitates increased competition and reduced procurement lead times,
enabling industry partners to provide more innovative solutions at better prices. As previously
mentioned in the acquisition planning topic, above, the competition requirements in FAR 6 and the
policies in FAR 15.3 do not automatically apply to the ordering process. FAR 16.505 instructs abou
ask order source selection.

Provision and Clause Configuration
Provisions and clauses supplementing the FAR, which are prescribed and included in authorized
agency acquisition regulations, may be added in task order requests so long as they are no
inconsistent with the basic contract’s terms. Refer to FAR 52.101(b)(2)(i)(A-C). The OCO is responsible
for clearly identifying the applicable provision and clause configuration in task order requests.

Step 3: Optional Scope Compatibility Reviews for Prospective Orders
GSA offers ordering agencies (typically ordering contracting officers) an opportunity to utilize the nocost scope compatibility review service for the Small Business GWACs. This quality assurance
measure has been made available for those federal agencies that would like assistance in determining
overall scope fit of a prospective requirement, or modification to an existing order, on a Small Business
GWAC.
Ordering agencies may request scope compatibility reviews at any time during the acquisition process
and are encouraged to do so prior to competing order opportunities or entering into directed order
negotiations. To get started review “Request an Optional Scope Review” on the GWAC website a
www.gsa.gov/gwacscopereview and follow the instructions. To be effective, the required documentation
must be submitted when requesting the review.

Step 4: Issue Task Order Request
Competitive Task Orders – Provide Fair Opportunity to be Considered
The Small Business GWACs were awarded using competitive procedures resulting in multiple awards.
Unless an exception applies, all orders with an estimated value expected to exceed the micropurchase
hreshold are to result from a fair opportunity to be considered per FAR 16.505(b)(1).
In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(iv), for task or delivery Orders in excess of $6,000,000, the
contracting agency’s obligation to provide “a fair opportunity to be considered” is not met unless all
industry partners are provided the following:
1) A notice of the Order that includes a clear statement of the agency’s requirements,
2) A reasonable period of time to provide a proposal in response to the notice,

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

13

U.S. General Services Administration

3) Disclosure of the significant factors and sub factors, including price or cost, which the agency
expects to consider in evaluating such proposals, and their relative importance,
4) In the case of an award that is to be made on a best-value basis, a written statemen
documenting the basis for the award and the relative importance of quality and price or cos
factors, and
5) An opportunity for a post-award debriefing if timely requested.
The government may disseminate RFI/RFQ/RFPs via GSA’s e-Buy at www.gsa.gov/ebuy, email, fax,
commercial mail carrier or other electronic means as prescribed by the OCO’s agency. Synopsis in the
government point of entry (GPE) is not generally required or recommended under indefinite-delivery
contracts, but may be required for specialized appropriations. OCOs should use a method of
disseminating task order requests that establishes receipt, and not just transmission. GSA’s e-Buy is
one such system.
The following pertain to all task orders:
1. Evaluation criteria will be established in the RFQ/RFP (price or cost will always be a criterion),
pursuant to FAR 16.505 with the aim of achieving best value. FAR Part 15 evaluations are no
required; however, if a FAR Part 15 task order request process is not intended, it is a bes
practice to state that in your RFQ/RFP. FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii) provides great latitude in designing
a streamlined evaluation methodology (e.g., multi-phased approach), and we encourage
utilizing that latitude in ways which are reasonable for your requirements,
2. Past experience may be evaluated at the prime or the subcontractor level depending on
Ordering agency needs,
3. Past performance was a criterion for basic contract award. OCOs may again use pas
performance as an evaluation criterion for task orders,
4. Either tradeoff or lowest price technically acceptable3 processes are valid best value methods
authorized for task order source selection,
5. Oral presentations may be implemented, and
6. The OCO may evaluate quotations and proposals without discussions and should make that a
clear expectation in the task order RFQ/RFP. If the OCO intends to award using a methodology
hat includes discussions, that should be clearly identified in the task order RFQ/RFP.

Directed Orders/Sole Source Orders
APPLICABLE TO 8(a) STARS III GWAC. See 8(a) STARS III specific information in Part II of this
ordering guide.

Exceptions to Fair Opportunity
Some acquisitions, though infrequent, may require an OCO to utilize a fair opportunity exception. Any
exception to the fair opportunity process must be consistent with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i). If an exception to

U.S. General Services Administration

the fair opportunity process is used, OCOs must ensure that justification, approval, and posting
requirements4 are completed in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii). These are the only exceptions:
1. The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would
result in unacceptable delays.
2. Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of
quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized,
3. The Order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a
logical follow-on to an Order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were
given a fair opportunity for the original Order,
4. It is necessary to place an Order to satisfy a minimum guarantee (reserved for the GWAC
PCO),
5. For Orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a statute expressly authorizes or
requires that the purchase be made from a specified source, and
6. In accordance with section 1331 of Public Law 111-240 (15 U.S.C. 644(r)), contracting officers
may, at their discretion, set aside orders for any of the small business concerns identified in
FAR 19.000(a)(3). When setting aside orders for small business concerns, the specific small
business program eligibility requirements identified in FAR 19 apply. When considering use of
his authority, See also SBA's final rule 85 FR 66146 effective November 16, 2020
7. For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the order satisfies one of the exceptions permitting the
use of other than full and open competition listed in 6.302 (10 U.S.C. 2304 c(b)(5)). The public
interest exception shall not be used unless Congress is notified in accordance with 10 U.S.C.
2304(c)(7)

Streamlined/Multi-Phased Task Order Competitions
A multi-phased approach is a streamlined evaluation process that may be used to save time and
resources for the industry partner and the government. There are several benefits to a streamlined
multi-phased approach, such as reducing the time and resources expended in the competition, lowering
proposal preparation costs, and improving the exchange of information between the government and
he offerors. Regardless of the approach chosen, all industry partners must be afforded a fair
opportunity to be considered, requiring a full understanding of FAR 16.505.
Various multi-phased approaches are feasible. A best practice is outlined below and consists of two
phases:

Phase One
1. Develop a preliminary RFQ or RFP that includes salient characteristics of the specific
requirement (e.g., work synopsis, cyber security needs, security clearance needs, specialized
information, certifications required, deliverables, response requirements, etc.) and discloses the
general basis on which selections will be made. Orders exceeding $6,000,000 must disclose
he significant factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that the agency expects to
consider in evaluating proposals, and their relative importance

U.S. General Services Administration

1. Instruct industry partner to inform the OCO of their affirmative interest in the competition
by the date shown in the preliminary RFQ or RFP or they will not be included in phase
wo. Include a statement that a non-response in the affirmative will constitute an opt-out,
2. Establish a response deadline that makes sense for phase one, understanding that the
bid/proposal effort for phase one is typically minimal for the industry partners. A few days
will typically suffice, and
3. Transmit the preliminary RFQ/RFP to the industry partners to determine their interest in
he competition, permitting them to opt-in or opt-out of phase two. GSA’s e-Buy is
recommended, which will allow the OCO to include only the chosen GWAC’s industry
partners and provides proof that that it was posted. Industry partners are responsible for
monitoring e-Buy and keeping their information current.
2. Maintain a record of the preliminary RFQ or RFP transmittal, evidence of receipt and responses
in the order file to document use of fair opportunity procedures. Using E-Buy provides a high
degree of assurance that fair opportunity to be considered has been provided.
3. The OCO must include all of the industry partners that have indicated interest in further
consideration/opted-in for phase two, but not those which did not respond in the affirmative
under phase one.

Phase Two
Please ensure that all industry partners which opted-in during Phase One receive a copy of the
RFQ or RFP in Phase Two. Historically, this process reduces the number of proposals by targeting
in Phase Two only those industry partners that have researched their current capabilities and
availability. It also provides useful acquisition planning/logistical/milestone information. GSA’s eBuy
is not recommended for Phase Two as it does not allow restriction to a sub-set of the industry
partners.

Step 5: Evaluate Proposals
OCOs should evaluate proposals based on criteria stated in the task order request and follow FAR
16.505.

Price Evaluation
The OCO is responsible for completing and documenting price reasonableness consistent with FAR
15.4.
The Contract Access Fee (CAF) is 0.75% to be applied to the total price for industry partner
performance as billed to the government on each task order. Industry partners are accountable to remi
required CAF to GSA. For VETS 2 and 8(a) STARS III, ordering contracting officers should include and
industry partners shall identify CAF as a separate CLIN within their proposals.

Fixed Price
The OCO must determine fair and reasonable pricing for all Fixed-Price orders in accordance with
FAR 15.4 and FAR 16.2. OCOs may find the competitive T&M and LH prices in the applicable
GWAC to be useful in developing government estimates.

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

16

U.S. General Services Administration

Time & Materials and Labor Hour
The competitive, fully burdened, ceiling rates on the individual basic contracts are very useful
pricing references for OCOs to incorporate into their price analysis for T&M and/or LH orders. This
ceiling pricing is available on the individual GWAC websites.
The OCO is responsible for considering the place of performance, level of effort, and the mix of
labor proposed to perform a specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price for
he task order is appropriate given the requirements and task order type.
Since negotiation and/or competition for orders may result in lower pricing, ceiling rates are not to
be accepted by OCOs automatically as verbatim order prices. The OCO should review order prices
in accordance with FAR 15.4, FAR 16.601 and FAR 16.602.
When specialized labor category requirements not included in the baseline requirements of the
established GWAC pricing apply that increase the cost of performance, e.g. specialized security
clearances, OCOs may allow industry partners to exceed established pricing. If this is planned by
he OCO it can be accounted for in the task order request instructions by requiring industry partners
o explain and justify in their task order quotes or proposals any rates that exceed those in the basic
contract. To that end, OCOs may require other than cost or pricing data in support of each rate tha
exceeds a basic contract rate to include, for example, a rate cost element breakdown in accordance
with the industry partner’s accounting system, as well as any other supporting information the OCO
deems necessary.
There are various payments clauses applicable to T&M or LH service procurements. The OCO
should ensure that the applicable payments clause(s) is clearly cited and configured in each order
RFQ/RFP and resulting task order. The FAR prescription for use and customer agency guidance on
choice of germane payments clause and its configuration provides sufficient detail for the OCO to
complete this responsibility. Please refer to Appendix IV for additional guidance regarding the
implementation of FAR 52.232-7, Payments under T&M and LH Contracts.

Incentives
The OCO must evaluate and determine the appropriateness of all Incentive terms and develop a
surveillance plan to implement and monitor an Award-Fee, Incentive-Fee, or Award-Term result in
accordance with FAR 15.4 and FAR 16.4. OCOs considering incentives are reminded of their
obligations under FAR 1.602-2.

Cost Reimbursement
The OCO must determine cost allowability, allocability and realism and also must analyze and
negotiate fee for all CR orders. Refer to FAR 15.4 and FAR 16.3.

Step 6: Task Order Award Documentation, Debriefings and Protests
Award Documentation
FAR 16.505(b)(7) -- Ordering, addresses that the OCO shall document in the Order file the rationale for
placement and price of each Order, including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs
among price or cost and non-cost considerations in making the award decision. This documentation
need not quantify the tradeoffs that led to the decision. The Order file shall also identify the basis for
using an exception to fair opportunity in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) – Exceptions to the Fair

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

17

U.S. General Services Administration

Opportunity Process. The document supporting the award should be sufficiently detailed to clearly
explain why the industry partner was selected for award.
Task orders may be issued on any federal agency authorized form and be distributed by mail, fax or email. Oral Orders are not authorized. In accordance with the delegation of procurement authority, one
copy of the task order and any subsequent modifications, along with a copy of the SOW/PWS/SOO,
shall be sent to GSA via email5

Claiming Socioeconomic Credit in FPDS-NG
.
Ordering agencies and third party assisted contracting services are required to report all orders greater
han the micropurchase threshold in FPDS-NG, www.fpds.gov in accordance with FAR 4.603. Proper
reporting ensures socioeconomic credit will be received.
The current FPDS-NG user’s guide is currently at www.fpds.gov.

Announcement of Award
Announcement of task order award to all competing offerors is strongly encouraged when a fair
opportunity to be considered is provided, especially for awards greater than $6,000,000. It is generally
not necessary to announce task order awards in. As previously mentioned, use of a fair opportunity
exception may require posting (FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D)). Please provide a copy of awards to the GSA in
accordance with the DPA.

Debriefing
In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(6), debriefings consistent with FAR 15.506, or authorized customer
agency supplement, are required when timely requested for Orders greater than $6,000,000.
Debriefings for Orders less than $6,000,000 are also encouraged, but are not required.

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures increase the opportunity for relatively inexpensive and
expeditious resolution of issues in controversy. These procedures may be used at any time that the
OCO has authority to resolve the issue in controversy. If the industry partner submits a claim, ADR
procedures may be applied to all or part of the claim. When ADR procedures are used after the
issuance of an OCO’s final decision, the time limitations or procedural requirements for filing an appeal
of the OCO’s final decision are not altered.

Task Order Level Protest
In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(10), no protest under $10,000,000 is authorized in connection with
he issuance or proposed issuance of an Order under a Task-Order Contract or Delivery-Order
Contract, except for a protest on the grounds that the Order increases the scope, period of
performance, or maximum value of the Contract. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has
exclusive jurisdiction over any Civilian Contract protests greater than $10,000,000.

Ombudsman
The GSA task and delivery order Ombudsman shall review and resolve complaints from contractors
concerning all task and delivery order actions made by GSA. Complaints regarding task and delivery
order actions of other agencies using GSA contract vehicles shall be directed to the ordering agency’s
Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman.
REMINDER: OCOs are required to complete the fill in information at 52.216-32 Task-Order and
Delivery-Order Ombudsman (Sept 2019) Alt I (d)(2) on all task orders.
For task and delivery orders issued by GSA, contact information for the GSA Ombudsman can be found
at: http://www.gsa.gov/ombudsman.

Step 7: Administer and Closeout the Task Order
Quality Assurance – Industry Partner Surveillance
The OCO is responsible for assuring that industry partner performance meets the minimum
requirements established in the task order, documenting the task order file and communicating with the
industry partner to ensure the government is receiving the contracted services. If industry partner
performance monitoring is delegated to a Contracting Officer Representative (COR) or Contracting
Officer Technical Representative (COTR), the specific authority/limitations should be documented in
accordance with FAR 1.602-2(d) and a copy provided to the industry partner.

Reporting Past Performance
At completion of order performance, and annually for orders with a period of performance exceeding
one year, the OCO is required by FAR 42.15 to complete a past performance record for the prime
contractor at the thresholds identified at FAR 42.1205(c) or in Agency Guidance. Customer agencies
participating in the Integrated Acquisition Environment have established a Governmentwide pas
performance platform relying upon CPARS as a feeder system to PPIRS.

Reporting and Task Order Closeout
The DPA provides details about the reporting expectations for OCOs. It is the OCO’s responsibility to
close out Orders per FAR 4.804. Please provide a copy of close out actions to the GSA in accordance
with the DPA.

Other Ordering Considerations
Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipmen
Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment Effective August 13, 2020; both the
8(a) STARS II and VETS 2 GWACs were modified to update FAR 52.204-25, Prohibition on Contracting
for Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment. Contract holders who
have accepted the modification can be found at the applicable GWAC Websites. For task orders
awarded prior to that date, Ordering Contracting Officers should follow their agency guidance
concerning the need to modify any existing task orders.
For task orders awarded prior to October 1, 2019, Ordering Contracting Officers should follow their
agency guidance concerning the need to modify any existing task orders to include FAR 52.204-25,

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

19

U.S. General Services Administration

Prohibition on Contracting for Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or
Equipment.

Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest
If a task order request might create a potential or actual conflict of interest, the OCO should identify the
potential or actual conflict and decide if a remediation approach is available which mitigates the risk or if
other appropriate action is necessary consistent with FAR 9.5. The OCO will routinely work with their
agency legal counsel on such matters.
If an OCO discovers a potential or actual conflict of interest after task order issuance, the OCO should
conduct due diligence and determine if the waiver discussed at FAR 9.503 is warranted and take
appropriate action.

Industry Partner Responsibility – Task Order Level
Overall responsibility has been determined for each GWAC industry partner per FAR 9.1. However, in
accordance with FAR 9.405-1, OCOs shall complete and document a review of active exclusions
(SAM.gov) on industry partners they intend to award task orders to prior to making each task order
award.

Task Order Funding
Funding for each order shall be at the order level. Incremental funding strategies may be used when
consistent with customer agency policy. OCOs should ensure that funding supporting order work is
appropriate for the type and range of contemplated work. All orders are subject to funding agency
appropriation guidelines.

Assuring IT Services are the Principal Purpose of Every Task Order
For a current definition of IT, see FAR 2.101. If your requirements include any of the following, a
complimentary advance scope compatibility review is highly recommended.

U.S. General Services Administration

Not Allowed on the Small Business GWACs
This is not an exhaustive list, but does illustrate some key matters:
•

Orders for which IT services are not the principal purpose,

•

Renting/ Leasing – an industry partner, as a private party, may enter into rental or lease
agreements for real or personal property in order to fulfill order requirements as a service, bu
he government will not be a signatory to such agreements,

•

Letter Contracts, Blanket Purchase Agreements, or Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type
arrangements

•

Oral orders, and

•

Orders for which supplies or software/hardware are the principal purpose.

Commercial Supplier Agreements
The basic contract vehicles include clauses to protect ordering activities from some common elements
within Commercial Supplier Agreements (CSA) that conflict with or are incompatible with federal law.
These clauses include 552.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (FAR Deviation),
552.232-39 Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations, and 552.232-78 Commercial Supplier
Agreements - Unenforceable Clauses. The OCO is permitted to further negotiate CSA terms and
conditions so long as negotiations do not yield task orders that conflict with the terms of the basic contrac
vehicle.

Cyber Security Considerations
Cyber Security requirements have the basic contract clause baseline. Further requirements may be buil
into the task order work statement and clauses by the ordering agency.

Security Clearance Considerations for Classified Task Orders
Security clearance requirements will be dictated by agency needs. Before issuing an RFI, RFQ or RFP
for a classified order, a determination should be made by the ordering agency as to whether or no
access to anything classified will be required during the task order request process. Appropriately
cleared personnel should manage work requiring clearance.

When Access is Required during Task Order Request Process
All prospective industry partners which may receive the RFI, RFQ or RFP must possess the
appropriate facility clearance, safeguarding capability and personnel security clearance in order
o access the task order request package. This may be determined by checking their credentials.

When Access is NOT Required during Task Order Request Process
Prospective industry partners do not have to possess facility clearances, safeguarding capability
and personnel clearances to receive or review the RFI/RFQ/RFP.

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

21

U.S. General Services Administration

Requests and task orders should specify if facility security clearance granted by a cognizant
security agency6 is required, and the highest required facility security clearance level. If the
customer agency prefers or requires clearances from a particular cognizant security agency, i
should be stated in the task order request.
Requests and task orders should specify if SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION,
TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL industrial personnel security clearances granted by
a cognizant security agency are required. Unless the requiring activity has a bona-fide reason for
precluding interim personnel security clearances, they should be considered equivalent to noninterim.
Requests and task orders should specify if cognizant security agency cleared safeguarding is
required and the highest required level. The safeguarding level should not exceed the facility
security clearance level.

Subcontracting
FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting, covers subcontracting considerations. All contrac
holders are responsible for managing the balance of workload being performed under their contract(s).
This requirement is monitored at the Master Contract level. However, when deemed necessary by the
OCO, limitations on subcontracting may be incorporated at the task order level.
While it is reasonable small business industry partners may manage capacity building through
subcontracting with other companies to provide scalability in the early stages of performance on large
ask orders, it is a best practice to require industry partners to disclose the amount of work they intend
o perform with their own resources in order quotations and proposals. Industry partner team
arrangements, in the form of prime contractor-subcontractor relationships, may be desirable from both a
government and industry standpoint in order to enable the companies involved to complement each
other’s unique capabilities and offer the government the best combination of performance, cost, and
delivery for the service being acquired.
OCO consent to subcontract may be implemented in accordance with FAR 44.2 and FAR 52.244-2.
OCOs may require subcontractor responsibility determinations of prospective subcontractors per FAR
9.103(b) and 9.104-1. When consent to subcontract is an order level requirement only OCO consent is
required, and not GWAC PCO consent.
See the GWAC-specific information in Part II for more subcontracting considerations for small business
GWACs.

Order Duration
For each Small Business GWAC, the basic contract ordering period is one five-year base period with
one five-year option period. See the contract for specifics.
The term for each task order placed under the basic contract shall be specified in the individual task
order, and subject to limits identified in each contract regarding order duration.
Task orders may be awarded during the Contract Ordering Period (COP). Task orders may not be
issued outside the COP.
6

There are four different cognizant security agencies, the Department of Defense, the Department of
Energy, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

22

U.S. General Services Administration

Use of an exception to a fair opportunity to be considered IS NOT A CONTRACT OPTION as
contemplated by FAR 17.2, it is a new order subject to award during the COP.
Awarded task order duration is not dependent upon the basic contract’s ordering period. This means
hat an OCO can exercise a task order option period even if the basic contract's ordering period is
complete. OCOs are required to document that task order options are in the best interest of the
government consistent with FAR 17.207 and any authorized customer agency supplement.
When citing options in an order, the price or cost for the performance of the work must be established
and evaluated in the initial order, including building in price or cost for any use of FAR 52.217-8.
Specific order duration guidelines for the individual GWACs are addressed in Part II of this ordering guide
and in the basic contracts online at their respective websites.

Task Order Size Rerepresentation
FAR 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Re-representation, addresses size rerepresentation under long term contracts such as the Small Business GWACs. However, OCOs have
he discretion to require a re-representation of the industry partner’s size status as a condition of task
order award. If an OCO intends to require a task order level size re-representation as a condition of
ask order award, they should explicitly make that assertion in the task order request by following the
guidance in Appendix V.
Additional business size considerations are addressed in the GWAC specific information in Part II of this
ordering guide

Task Order Request Cancellation
Cancellation of a task order RFQ/RFP is at the discretion of the OCO. RFQ cancellation requires
minimal justification while RFP cancellation may be necessary and justified for any or all of the three (3)
reasons listed below (drawn from best practices in case law), and it is a good practice for the OCO to
document the cancellation decision rationale and have the cancellation decision approved pursuant to
OCO agency policy:
•

Services are no longer required, or are significantly changed;

•

All offers received are at unreasonable prices, or only one offer is received, and the OCO
cannot determine the reasonableness of the price;

•

For other reasons, cancellation is clearly in the public’s interest.

Service Contract Labor Standards
The Small Business GWACs labor categories are considered bona-fide executive, administrative,
professional labor and generally exempt from the Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS). To the
extent that any labor is subject to the SCLS and within scope of a task order and the individual GWAC, the
OCO must identify such work under a separate CLIN on the task order and apply wages in accordance
with FAR 22.10.

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

23

U.S. General Services Administration

The GWACs do not include all applicable flow-down clauses for labor categories subject to the SCLS.
Each task order must be tailored to include the appropriate clauses.

U.S. General Services Administration

Wage Rate Requirements (Construction)
OCOs are reminded that the IT services must be the principal purpose of each task order. The OCO
shall ensure the compatibility of appropriations.
To the extent that construction, alteration and repair are subject to the Wage Rate Requirements
(Construction) and within scope of a task order and the GWAC, the OCO must identify such work under
a separate CLIN on the task order and apply wages in accordance with FAR 22.404. Any construction,
alteration and repair shall be firm fixed price, even if other aspects of the task order are another type.
The GWACs do not include all applicable flow-down clauses for labor categories subject to the Wage
Rate Requirements (Construction). Each task order must be tailored to include the appropriate clauses.

Rights in Data
Rights in Data is a highly specialized area. The OCO should ensure that the applicable Rights in Data
clause(s) is clearly assigned in each task order request and resulting task order.

Pre-Award EEO Clearance
EEO Clearance was obtained prior to award of the master contracts in accordance with FAR 22.805.

Rights Reserved by the GWAC PCO
Only GWAC PCOs are authorized to modify basic contract terms and conditions and authorize DPAs.
OCOs may not transfer DPA.

8(a) STARS III GWAC
The 8(a) STARS III GWAC (STARS III) is a competitively awarded, multiple-award, indefinitedelivery, indefinite-quantity contract. STARS III was authorized under the provisions of Section 8(a) of
he Small Business Act 15 U.S.C. 637(a), and supports both competitive orders per FAR 16.505 and
sole source orders per FAR 19.8. STARS III resulted from a competitive 8(a) procurement, which was
offered to and accepted into the SBA 8(a) program, therefore competitive orders do not have to be
offered and accepted into the 8(a) program, and all STARS III awardees are eligible to compete and
be awarded those task orders. See below for further information about handling sole source orders.
Note: in accordance with 13 CFR 124.504(d) and FAR 19.815, 8(a) STARS III task orders
are 8(a) awards
STARS III enables federal agencies to fulfill mission requirements and, at the same time, assists in
meeting or exceeding socioeconomic goals through the utilization of businesses which were both
certified and verified as eligible 8(a) program participants by the SBA. Federal agencies may earn
applicable socioeconomic procurement preference credits that each industry partner possesses.
STARS III is an eight-year contract, consisting of one five-year base and one three-year option
period, affording the opportunity for industry partners to develop and create sustainable businesses.
STARS III has a maximum contract life cycle value of $50 billion.

Scope
STARS III provides Federal agencies with IT services and IT services-based solutions, both
commercial and non-commercial, as defined in the Clinger-Cohen Act and FAR 2.101. IT
services-based solutions can be tailored to meet an agency’s particular mission needs and may
include new and emerging technologies that evolve over the life of the contract. The principal
nature of any resulting Order must be for IT services; however ancillary support may be included
when it is integral to and necessary for the IT services-based solution. Services may be
performed at Government and/or Contractor locations worldwide, as specified in each Order.
Provisions and clauses that supplement the FAR, which are prescribed and included in
authorized agency acquisition regulations, may be added at the order level so long as they do
not conflict with the basic contract. OCOs are responsible for clearly identifying the applicable

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

27

U.S. General Services Administration

provision and clause configuration in order solicitations. Refer to FAR 52.101(b)(2)(i)(A-C) for
examples of provisions and clauses.
The geographical scope of coverage is worldwide, and organizations authorized by GSA
ORDER OGP 4800.2I, Eligibility to use GSA Sources of Supply and Services (and any future
versions) may use the STARS III GWAC. In the context of STARS III, IT services encompasses
requirements having a principal purpose/core work grounded in IT services NAICS including, bu
not limited to 541511, 541512, 541513, 541519 and 518210. The primary NAICS for this
contract is 541512.
STARS III’s scope generally provides flexibility at the order level to include ancillary support tha
he government determines to be integral to, and necessary for, the IT services-based solution.
STARS III’s scope is agile and will automatically keep pace as IT evolves.
In addition to the primary 8(a) STARS III scope area, STARS III includes two focused subareas to accommodate emerging technology and OCONUS requirements: See section C.2 of
he contract for additional information.
●

Emerging Technology Sub-area (Sub-Area 1)- This sub-area provides for IT services-based
solutions which involve emerging technology (ET) innovation to securely accelerate
ransformation and advance mission outcomes. A task order requirement (TOR) fits in this
subarea if it includes IT services-based solutions with ET as the focus.
ET can be understood as evolving state-of-the-art information technologies and their use in
solutioning to improve and/or transform business processes and enhance mission delivery. ET
includes those technologies that are not yet mature in the marketplace and have the potential
for wide-spread adoption. These technologies are in the early stages of their life cycles and
have been implemented by early adopters. Rather than specifying predetermined technology
solutions, agencies considering ET are encouraged to succinctly focus on articulating in the
TOR the business problems they face, e.g. through the use of a statement of objective
approach.

●

OCONUS Sub-area (Sub-Area 2)- This sub-area provides for IT services-based solutions to be
performed outside the contiguous United States (OCONUS). A TOR can fit in this sub-area if
he scope is primarily IT services and it includes performance in an OCONUS location.
OCONUS work locations include the non-foreign work areas of Alaska and Hawaii, the
Commonwealths of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands and the territories
and possessions of the United States (excluding the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands) as
well as foreign work areas (see section B.12 of the contract for additional information).

Contract Ordering Period and Order Duration
The ordering period for 8(a) STARS III began on July 2, 2021. The Master Contract ordering period is
one five-year base period with one three-year option period.
Per FAR 52.217-9, the three-year option period is a unilateral government right and is no
guaranteed.

Sole Source
STARS III allows for sole source orders under the 8(a) competitive threshold (FAR 19.8051(a)(2)). The rationale at FAR 19.804-2(a)10, (i) or (ii), is relevant to sole source orders.
The 5th Fair Opportunity Exception, FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(E), is typically applicable to
STARS III sole source orders. When documenting the exception justification in
accordance with FAR 16.505 (b)(2)(ii), the statute authorizing sole source orders is the
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a).
Sole Source orders to Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)/Tribal Owned/Native
Hawaiian Organization (NHO) 8(a) concerns
Although the 8(a) STARS III GWAC was awarded competitively, the competitive
hresholds identified at 13 CFR 124.5067 apply to an order level requirement and may
not be used as a rationale to prohibit allowing orders to ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concerns
on a sole source order basis above the competitive threshold at FAR 19.805-1(a)(2). A
STARS III order requirement initially solicited on a competitive basis may not be
removed from competition and subsequently awarded to an ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a)
concern on a sole source basis.
Offer and Acceptance
Agencies may identify a sole-source requirement for the 8(a) program, independently or through selfmarketing efforts of an 8(a) participant. The ordering contracting office shall notify the SBA via offer
letter. The offer letter should include the information in FAR 19.804-2(a). A sample offer letter and
SBA district office information are included as an appendix to this ordering guide (see Appendix VII).

Sole source requirement offer letters should be forwarded directly to the district office that services
he nominated 8(a) participant. We recommend you check their 8(a) profile on SBA’s Dynamic Small
Business Search (DSBS) for their latest SBA servicing office:
https://web.sba.gov/pro-net/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm.
SBA has many executed partnership agreements with federal agencies which represent the
delegation of the SBA’s 8(a) contract execution authority to streamline the contract execution
process. Federal agencies without an executed partnership agreement must continue to process 8(a)
contracts using the procedures of CFR § 124.508 and FAR § 19.8. Below is a link to the curren
partnership agreements:
https://www.sba.gov/document/support--sba-and-agencies-partnership-agreements
Upon receipt of the contracting officer's offer letter, SBA will determine whether to accept the solesource requirement for the 8(a) program, if the NAICS code designation is suitable, and whether or
not the requested STARS III awardee is eligible per the requirements of 13 CFR 124.503(c)(1). The
acceptance timeframes are outlined in FAR 19.804-3, unless the agency has a partnership
agreement with SBA, in which case they are spelled out in that. Be sure to request confirmation of
receipt when submitting an offer letter to SBA to begin the clock.
Please note: If an 8(a) industry partner exits the SBA 8(a) program, the SBA might not accept the
offering letter for a sole source requirement. However, the industry partner should remain eligible to
compete for task orders.

Competitive Orders
Competition over the sole source threshold
Competitive requirements must be competed among all 8(a) contract holders in the selected scope area
IAW 13 CFR 124.503(i)(1)(ii).
Competition under the sole source threshold
In order to do a competition under the competitive threshold and unless the SBA-agency partnership
agreement provides an exception, the ordering agency must seek and receive approval from the
SBA. The reference below is from 13 CFR 124.506(c).
(a) Competition below thresholds. The Associate Administrator for Business Developmen
(AA/BD), on a non-delegable basis, may approve a request from a procuring activity to
compete a requirement that is below the applicable competitive threshold amount among
eligible Participants.
(1) This authority will be used primarily when technical competitions are
appropriate or when a large number of potential awardees exist.
(2) The AA/BD may consider whether the procuring activity has made and will
continue to make available a significant number of its contracts to the 8(a) BD
program on a noncompetitive basis.

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

30

U.S. General Services Administration

(3) The AA/BD may deny a request if the procuring activity previously offered the
requirement to the 8(a) BD program on a noncompetitive basis and the request is
made following the inability of the procuring activity and the potential sole source
awardee to reach an agreement on price or some other material term or condition.

The current SBA AA/BD can be located at http://www.sba.gov/about-offices-content/1/2467.

Geographic Pricing Considerations
8(a) STARS III Pricing is based on 124 labor categories at either government or contractor sites.
Master Contract maximum labor rates were established based on order performance in the
Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA area as defined by the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM). Ordering agencies may adjust labor rates on orders with a place
of performance outside the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA area based on
current geographic locality areas and differentials as published annually by OPM. These areas
and rates are subject to change, please see section J-3 of the contract.
OCOs need to make a conscious planned choice on the locality ground rules they require industry
partners to quote or propose upon for Established Labor Categories (those already priced in
STARS III) when working with the time and materials and/or labor hour contract types.
Geographic Pricing Considerations

Changes in 8(a) Company Ownership and Termination from the 8(a) Program
Generally, 8(a) program termination is associated with changes in ownership of the 8(a) participan
excluding it from continuing to receive 8(a) program benefits. SBA 8(a) regulations require curren
8(a) program participants to report ownership changes to SBA, which parallels the notification of
merger or acquisition to the contracting officer per FAR 52.219-28. SBA is vested with the authority to

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

31

U.S. General Services Administration

determine if a current 8(a) program participant will or will not be terminated from the 8(a) program due
o an ownership change.
●

A STARS III industry partner who has an ownership change, and remains an active 8(a)
program participant, will generally not have its STARS III contract cancelled or terminated
by GSA. The practical impact being:
1) Existing orders with the industry partner may continue,
2) Pre-priced options on said existing orders may be exercised at the OCO’s discretion, and
3) New orders may be awarded, subject to other conditions, e.g. sole source offer-acceptance.

●

A STARS III industry partner who has an ownership change, and does not remain an active
8(a) program participant, will be afforded the opportunity for a bilateral contract cancellation,
or have its STARS III contract terminated by GSA. The practical impact being:
1) Existing orders with the industry partner may continue, and
2) Pre-priced options on said existing orders may be exercised at the OCO’s discretion

Size Status
FAR 52.219-28 Post Award Small Business Program re-representation addresses size rerepresentation under long term contracts such as STARS III. The triggering events for size rerepresentation per FAR 52.219-28 on long term contracts such as STARS III, are in association
with merger or acquisition and prior to the long-term contract’s sixth year.

Effect of Merger and Acquisition
FAR 52.219-28 requires that the 8(a) STARS III industry partner report to a STARS III ACO
within 30 days of a merger or acquisition whereupon size re-representation by the industry
partner is required. If the industry partner re-represents as other than a small business concern, i
is reclassified as such on STARS III and will be afforded the opportunity for a bilateral contrac
cancellation, and/or have its STARS III contract cancelled or terminated by GSA and 1-3 below
apply.
1) Existing orders with the industry partner may continue,
2) Pre-priced options on existing orders may be exercised at the OCO’s discretion
but they will not provide socioeconomic credit, and
3) Generally no new orders may be awarded
Alternatively, if the industry partner re-represents as a small business concern and is still
an active 8(a) program participant, refer to the section captioned “Changes of 8(a)
Company Ownership and Termination from the 8(a) Program”.
Alternatively, if the industry partner re-represents as a small business concern but has
graduated or graduated early from the 8(a) program, contract novation regulations at FAR
42.12 apply. GSA will not support mergers with or acquisitions by non-8(a) program
participants. The practical impact being:

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

32

U.S. General Services Administration

1) Existing orders with the industry partner may continue,
2) Pre-priced options on existing orders may be exercised at the OCO’s discretion
but they will not provide socioeconomic credit, and
3) Generally no new orders may be awarded. However, it is possible at the OCO’s
discretion to award a new order IF the quote or proposal including responsive
pricing was received by the OCO prior to the date of the merger or acquisition.
Once GSA updates FPDS-NG with the results of the size re-representation,
orders awarded under this exception will not receive socioeconomic credit.

Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
Ordering contracting officers may specify applicable CMMC requirements at the order level.

Other Cybersecurity & Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)
Ordering contracting officers may specify applicable cybersecurity and SCRM requirements at the order
level. The 8(a) STARS III contract, attachment J-4, presents many of the possible, but does not limit, the
cybersecurity and SCRM standards.

VETS 2 GWAC
The VETS 2 GWAC offers a unique contribution to the federal acquisition community as it’s the only
GWAC set-aside exclusively for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). VETS 2
is a ten-year (five-year base, with a five-year option) contract that has a maximum contract value of
$5 billion. VETS 2 is designed to meet a variety of diverse agency IT requirements, including new and
emerging technologies. VETS 2 also enables GSA to support the SDVOSB Procurement Program, while
helping federal agencies achieve their socioeconomic goals and objectives.

Scope
The scope of the VETS 2 GWAC provides Federal agencies with customized IT services and IT
services-based solutions, both commercial and noncommercial, as defined in the Clinger-Cohen Ac
and FAR 2.101. Customized IT services-based solutions, which can be tailored to meet an agency’s
particular mission needs, may include any combination of the IT services identified in Section C of the
VETS 2 contract, including new and emerging technologies that evolve over the life of the Master
Contract. The principal nature of any resulting task order procurement must be for IT services; however
ancillary support may be included when it is integral to and necessary for the IT services-based effort.
Services may be performed at Government and Contractor locations worldwide, as specified in each
ask order.
Examples of services available under VETS 2 include, but are not limited to:
• Data Managemen
• Information and Communications Technology
• IT Operations and Maintenance
• IT Security
• Software Developmen
• Systems Design
• New and Emerging Technologies
The primary NAICS Code for VETS 2 is 541512, but it does not delimit the scope. For scope refer to
Section C of the basic contract.

Subcontracting Considerations
In accordance with the 13 CFR 125.6(b)(1), 13 CFR 125.15 and FAR clause 52.219-27 Notice of
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, VETS 2 contractors are required to
perform at least 50 percent of cost of personnel for master contract performance with their own
employees or employees of other service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.
This requirement is monitored at the Master Contract level. However, when deemed necessary by the
OCO, limitations on subcontracting may be incorporated at the task order level.
Specifying that VETS 2 contractors shall disclose the work they intend to perform with their own
resources, with the resources of other SDVOSBs and with non-SDVOSBs is a best practice in task
order solicitations which don’t establish a SDVOSB participation evaluation factor.

Cost Reimbursement Orders
While most of the VETS 2 contractors have a cost accounting system that has been audited and
determined adequate by DCAA or another Cognizant Federal Agency, only those contractors that hold
a cost accounting system meeting these conditions may respond to cost reimbursement task order
requests. An OCO that is willing to sponsor an audit may specify within the task order request that this
requirement does not apply. For more information, refer to Sections B.8.2 and H.13 of the Master
Contract.
OCOs must verify the adequacy of a contractor’s cost accounting system prior to awarding any cos
reimbursement task order.

Facility Clearance Requirements
While most VETS 2 contractors have Secret or Top Secret Facility Clearances, only those Offerors tha
hold the required facility clearance may respond to task order requests requiring a facility clearance. An
OCO that is willing to sponsor a facility clearance can specify within the task order request that this
requirement does not apply.
When required for a task order, an OCO must verify the contractor’s facility clearance. When classified
work is required on an individual task order, the Contract Security Classification Specification, (DD
Form 254 or agency equivalent) will be issued to the Contractor by the requiring agency.

Appendix IV – Additional Guidance for Implementation of FAR 52.232-7
FAR 16.601(f) T&M Contracts requires contracting officers to use one of three provisions in solicitations
(referred to as task order request in this ordering guide) contemplating the use of T&M or LH type
contracts. To determine which provision is appropriate for a given order, OCOs should answer the
following questions:
1. Does my requirement meet the FAR definition for a commercial item?
If yes, use FAR 52.216-31 T&M/LH Proposal Requirements—Commercial Item Acquisition. As the title of
he provision implies, FAR 52.216-31 is used for commercial item acquisitions. In this scenario, an offeror
must specify separate fixed hourly rates in its offer that include wages, overhead, general and
administrative expenses, and profit for each category of labor to be performed by the offeror
subcontractors, and or divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the offeror under a common control.
2. If my requirement doesn’t meet the FAR definition for a commercial item, is adequate price
competition expected?
If adequate price competition is expected, use FAR 52.216-29 T&M/LH Proposal Requirements—
Noncommercial Item Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition. As the title of the provision implies,
FAR 52.216-29 is used for noncommercial item acquisitions when the OCO anticipates adequate price
competition. FAR 15.403-1(c) provides the accepted standards for what constitutes adequate price
competition.
In this scenario and pursuant to FAR 52.216-29(c), the offeror must specify fixed hourly rates in its offer
hat include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit using:
(1). Separate rates for each category of labor to be performed by each subcontractor, the offeror, and
for each category of labor to be transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the
offeror under a common control;
(2). Blended rates for each category of labor to be performed by the offeror including labor transferred
between divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates of the offeror under a common control, and all
subcontractors; or
(3). Any combination of separate and blended rates for each category of labor to be performed by the
offeror, affiliates of the offeror under common control, and subcontractors.
NOTE: If authorized by ordering agency procedures, FAR 16.601(f) permits contracting
officers to amend the provision to make mandatory one of the three approaches described
above.
NOTE: For the Department of Defense, pursuant to FAR 52.216-29 with DFARS 252.2167002, Alternate A, the offeror is required to only provide separate loaded hourly labor rates
for prime contractor labor, each subcontractor, and/or each division, subsidiary, or
affiliate. The offeror must specify whether each loaded hourly labor rate applies to the
prime contractor, each subcontractor, and/or each division, subsidiary or affiliate.
3. My requirement doesn’t meet the FAR definition for a commercial item and I don’t expec
adequate price competition. Which provision do I use?
Use FAR 52.216-30 T&M/LH Proposal Requirements—Noncommercial Item Acquisition without Adequate
Price Competition. As a reminder, FAR 15.403-1(c) provides the accepted standards for what constitutes

Small Business GWAC Ordering Guide-Nov. 18, 2021

adequate price competition. In this scenario, the offeror must specify separate fixed hourly rates in its
offer that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit for each category of
labor to be performed by the offeror, each subcontractor, and each division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
offeror under a common control.

Appendix V – Task Order Size Rerepresentation
Quality of service delivery and socioeconomic public policy (e.g., small business goals/socioeconomic
credit) are key reasons why government customers use GWACs. Quality of service delivery is assured by
he evaluation process required of industry partners to win a position on a GWAC, and also by the flexible
customer-controlled order evaluation and award process during which customers control evaluations
echniques designed to select an industry partner to fulfill their mission objectives.
In support of socioeconomic public policy, all industry partners on the GWAC were duly recorded as small
business concerns in FPDS-NG at GWAC award, making them small businesses on the GWAC – a term
of art that is beneficial for customers to know. However, as time passes, circumstances sometimes
change for an industry partner whereby it is no longer considered a small business concern in general,
and more limited circumstances can make an industry partner no longer considered a small business
concern on a federal contract, whereupon the industry partner no longer provides any socioeconomic
credit for new orders.
This matters, because in order to award an order to a small business on the GWAC that provides
socioeconomic credit for new orders, the selected industry partner must not have had a change in
circumstances to its small business status resulting in it becoming other than a small business on the
GWAC.
What circumstances lead to a GWAC industry partner becoming other than a small business on
he GWAC?
1) Merger or acquisition with or without novation - an immediate trigger that requires rerepresentation on the GWAC within 30 days, and subsequent re-coding as other than a small
business concern per FAR 52.219-28 if the merged or acquired organization does not remain a
small business concern.
2) Organic growth that, at the contract option, results in an industry partner not remaining a small
business concern entering the 6th year of the contract, as a result of the size re-representation
required for the contract option period.
How do I know if a GWAC industry partner remains a small business on the GWAC?
The Small Business GWAC Division maintains lists, presently in spreadsheet format, on the individual
GWAC’s website. Industry partner small business status is indicated on the list.
What regulations that govern these matters?
FAR 52.219-28
FAR Final Rule 74 FR 11821 & 14492
SBA Final Rule 71 FR 66434

(www.acquisition.gov)
(www.gpoaccess.gov)
(www.gpoaccess.gov)

As a government customer, what can I do to assure an order is awarded to an industry partner
hat is a small business on the GWAC?
Because there might be a slight lag between a company becoming other than small, and it fulfilling its
obligation to report to GSA pursuant to FAR 52.219-28, which provides for such reporting to be slightly in
arrears, the Division recommends OCOs not simply rely upon the information about industry partner size
status maintained on the individual GWAC websites, and instead implement an Order Size
Rerepresentation (OSR). Pursuant to SBA’s regulatory framework, GAO and the Federal Court have
upheld a procuring agency’s authority to request size certifications with respect to particular orders. See
LB&B Associates, Inc. v. U.S., 68 Fed. Cl. 765 (Fed. Cl. 2005); CMS Information Services, Inc., B–

290541, Aug 7, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 132. Accordingly, an OCO has the discretion to require a
rerepresentation of the GWAC industry partners’ size status as a condition of order award.
OSR Template
An OCO may incorporate the following OSR language into task order requests in order to require
rerepresentation as a condition of order award:

Notice of Order Size Rerepresentation (OSR) at the Order Level
Offers are solicited only from <insert GWAC name> industry partners that have not rerepresented as

riggers the notification requirements contained in FAR 52.219-28(b)(1) or (b)(2), and are other than small
as a result of said triggering event, are considered to be other than a small business concern for the
purposes of this procurement regardless of whether the industry partner has fulfilled the rerepresentation
notification pursuant to FAR 52.219-28.
Offers received from <insert GWAC name> industry partners that have rerepresented their size status as
other than small under the <insert GWAC name>, or have had a triggering event and are not currently
considered small business concerns under the <insert GWAC name> are not desired and shall be
rejected as non-conforming with this OSR. The following representation must be completed and
submitted with the offer.
I hereby represent that my company (check one) ____ has ____has not rerepresented itself as other than
a small business concern under <insert GWAC name>, and (check one)____has ____has no
