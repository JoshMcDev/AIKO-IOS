How to Acquire Furniture through Your
Reimbursable Work Authorization (RWA)
Learn about the Proper Use of Your Agency’s Funds Accepted by GSA Public Buildings Service for
Furniture
Overview
The GSA Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (IWAC) provides assisted acquisition services to
federal agencies in support of their furniture procurements. At times IWAC deals directly with the
client agency, but other times IWAC partners with GSA’s Public Buildings Service (PBS) to provide a
urnkey workplace solution. This paper describes the guiding principles that IWAC applies when
making the decision to accept funding via PBS when offering a joint, turnkey solution.
IWAC recognizes that the application of these guidelines represent an additional step in the funding
process. However, as a contracting activity, IWAC believes that by raising appropriate financial
questions we can better serve our customers and protect the interests of GSA as a whole.
This paper establishes criteria to determine whether annual funds may be properly transferred from
GSA PBS to GSA FAS and contractually obligated in a subsequent fiscal year. The following criteria
must apply prior to funds transfer from PBS to FAS
1. A non-severable, turn-key solution (i.e includes build-out, furniture, and personal property)
arising in the same year as the appropriation
2.

Continuous and expedient effort towards the completion of the turnkey solution

Background
Agencies provide funding to PBS via RWA for the purpose of acquiring office space. Upon
acceptance of the RWA, the funding becomes obligated from the perspective of the client agency.
Because lead times for construction and lease build-out projects typically exceed one year, it is often
he case GSA must contractually obligate the funding over a two- to five-year period.
Oftentimes, furniture is one of the last things purchased. Due to IWAC’s subject matter expertise, PBS
frequently delegates that task to IWAC. Given that the funds may have originated from a prior fiscal
year at the point of IWAC engagement by PBS, IWAC must apply certain tests to determine if the
funding remains available for contractual obligation. IWAC arrived at these principles based on
guidance from the OMB Red Book, the FAR, internal PBS RWA guidance, and feedback from legal
counsel.
During the course of conversations, GSA and its customers refer to the five-year availability of funds
hat has been accepted by GSA via an RWA. It should not be inferred that money accepted by GSA
has lost its fiscal year identity. When GSA bills against prior fiscal year funds, it constitutes a
liquidation of funds and such liquidations can occur up to five years after RWA acceptance by GSA.
However, certain conditions must apply.
As for the conditions that must be met, IWAC seeks to validate the following:

Availability of Funds
IWAC recognizes the unique mission of GSA whereby it acts on a fee-for-service basis via
interagency agreements. While not enforceable in the way that contracts are, it has been
acknowledged that they resemble contracts in ways important to this discussion. Most significantly,
GAO report B-302760 states the following:
An interagency transaction, like that authorized by section 141(c), is, in some ways, not unlike a
contractual transaction. Similar to a contractual transaction, at the time the agencies involved in the
ransaction enter into an interagency agreement, the ordering agency incurs an obligation for the costs
of the work to be performed, and the amount obligated remains available to pay these costs once the
work is completed.
In this report, GAO explicitly acknowledges that funding obligated by an interagency agreemen
remains available until project completion. In addition, the PBS RWA Guide Page 63 acknowledges
hat the RWA constitutes a contract for the purpose of recording a valid obligation since under the
RWA, PBS must perform the service requested and the cost of the performance must be reimbursed
by the customer agency. The signed RWA authorizes GSA to execute the scope of the customer
request based on the authorized amount. Thus, IWAC maintains that it may access funding from a
prior fiscal year.
Non-Severable Need
Most frequently, the concept of non-severable services applies to contracts for services. Generally, i
acknowledges that certain services are ongoing in nature and can end at various points with the
Government having obtained value. Cleaning services are often cited as an example of a severable
service because cleaning is an ongoing need and the Government receives continuous benefit.
Whereas, software development would be non-severable because if performance ended prior to
project completion, any work products provided to the Government would be virtually worthless
because the desired end product is a functioning application.
In the case of joint PBS/IWAC projects, a tenant typically presents to PBS a request for a turnkey
solution for fully functional office space, inclusive of furniture. In this instance, the project represents
a non-severable requirement, as a client agency cannot occupy a space without furniture. For these
reasons, IWAC believes that it is reasonable to conclude that furniture is non-severable from other
space related tasks such as construction and tenant improvements. Before accepting prior fiscal year
funding document, a contract specialist must validate that furniture is non-severable from build out.
In performing this validation, the specialist must determine that:
1.
2.
3.

All client funding is provided from one source (i.e. RWA)
The funding belongs to the fiscal year in which the need arose
The RWA makes reference to furniture and build-out within one projec

While the first two items require little explanation, the 3rd item often requires discussion and or
supplementary documentation. Condition 3 states that furniture must be included in the original
bona fide need. It is critical that this is included at the time this funding document/RWA is created as
he bona fide need cannot be changed in a subsequent fiscal year.

Continuous and Expedient Effort
Because the furniture procurement occurs at the later stages of a turnkey project, the money will
likely be from a prior fiscal year. To demonstrate that the furniture procurement is occurring within a
reasonable window of time past, IWAC must establish that GSA worked continuously and expediently
owards fulfilling the tenant agencies need. To establish this, IWAC may request supporting
documentation to include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Project schedules (including updated versions)
Acquisition planning documents
Documentation to explain schedule delays
SF 81’s
Supplementary documents tied to RWAs

How to Notify GSA’s IWAC of Your RWA that Includes Furniture
To notify IWAC, contact Kristine Stein, 215-446-4897, kristine.stein@gsa.gov. Please contact Kristine
prior to any GSA Public Building Service (PBS) acceptance of any Reimbursable Work Authorization
(RWA) that includes furniture requirements and requires IWAC contracting support.
