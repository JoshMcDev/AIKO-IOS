## TASK ORDER TEMPLATE

Multifunction Device and Network Printer
Fleet Assessmen
TEMPLATE 1: Device Discovery, Cost and Energy Baselines, Optimization
Recommendations
Template 1 is designed for the purpose of conducting an initial information gathering
assessment in a print output environment. Template 1 is for a task that will be
conducted at least 2-12 months prior to procuring devices under Functional Area II or
managing devices under Functional Area III, depending on the scope and complexity of
he assessment.
(Enter Ordering Activity Agency Name)
(The following is an example of a Performance Work Statement)

DATE: (Enter date)
Background: Describe background information about your agency’s requirements. The
definition of an “imaging fleet” is the sum of all devices that print, copy, scan, or fax a
hard copy document within a defined environment. Describe your agency’s “imaging
fleet”.
Include the size of the organization, current knowledge about the state of the MFD and
NP environment, and operational responsibility for the MFD and NP fleet.
1.0 Scope of Work: Describe the elements of work that is being requested as
outlined in this document. The initial fleet assessment and needs analysis process
is comprised of three phases that include, but are not necessarily limited to,
discovery of all hardware in the ordering activity’s existing fleet; discovery and
analysis of existing output volumes; discovery and analysis of monthly or annual
spend; workflow analysis; and optimization recommendations. Fleet assessments
should yield deliverables in the form of organizational reports and analyses
designed to assist an agency in reducing the TCO of a fleet and improving
operational efficiencies.

Phase I: Device Discovery: Identify the locations of the imaging fleet to be
inventoried.

Task A: Device Discovery using Automated Data Collection Agent: The contractor
may deploy data collection tools designed to automatically discover all of the prin
output devices residing on an identified network. These tools may include software
packages that will reside on the agency’s network, or workstation discovery tools
hat will require access to the network via workstations, but will not physically
reside on the network. Contractors may also provide a combination of both.
The data collection tools are designed to identify the devices currently residing on
he network and provide detailed usage information for those devices. Basic usage
information should include:




Device make and model
Serial number or other unique identifier
Page coun

More detailed information may be available, and as part of the ordering process,
he ordering activity should identify the additional data elements that are to be
collected. Additional usage information includes, but is not limited to:









B&W page count
Color page coun
Duplex/Simplex page coun
Page count by size
Installation location
Installation date
Device status
Supply levels

Task B: Device Discovery using Manual Processes: For those scenarios that may
prohibit the use of DCAs, the contractors are prepared to or perform data collection
services (such as device discovery and meter reads) through a manual process. As par
of the ordering process, the ordering activity should identify the scope of the
requirement that will require manual data collection.
The manual collection process will require basic device information and meter reads to
be collected directly from the device, by physically extrapolating the information through
he device’s control panel.
Because of the increase in labor that will be required to perform the manual collection
process, ordering activities are strongly encouraged to promote the use of DCAs.

Tasks A and B Deliverables: The contractor shall provide a comprehensive list of
he results of its discovery process with the data elements requested outlined in
Task A. If the ordering activity requires a specific format in which the collected is to
be displayed, the format should be identified as part of the ordering process.
Phase II: Spend Analysis: The Contractor will work with the ordering activity to collect all
available spend data related to the existing fleet. “Spend data” is defined as any
electronic or hard copy data that can be produced by the ordering activity that shows
he dollar amount expended for a particular product or service within the identified fleet.
The spend data should cover a period of time that is identified by the ordering activity a
he task order level.
Task C: Comprehensive Description of Current and/or Past Spend Elements: Below
are examples of cost components that should be considered in the contractor’s estimate
of spend. Additional concrete cost factors may also be identified.








Consumables cost (e.g., purchase price, click price, and supply delivery cost for
oner and parts)
Maintenance and repair costs
Device prices (e.g., lease, rental, and purchase prices)
Usage costs (e.g., allowance, overage rate, cost per click, flat rate)
Energy costs
Lease termination costs
Depreciation costs

In addition to comprehensively assessing cost given the needs of an agency, the
Contractor shall differentiate between past and current costs and identify a period of
ime associated with past costs.
Task D: Assumptive Analysis: For cases where an ordering activity may be unable to
provide the Contractor with spend data for the existing fleet, the Contractor should be
asked to provide a plan to generate an estimated spend using a combination of
assumptive analyses and estimated values of the existing goods and services within the
fleet. The assumptive analysis process will be designed to model past agency spend
where the data is unavailable and should be based on established pricing rates within
existing Government supply markets.
The primary purpose of the data should be to enable the agency to understand its
current print environment and to prove savings achieved by better managing prin
decisions.
Task E: Baseline Metrics Establishment: Once the data collection process is
completed, the Contractor shall use the data to establish the current and past total cos
of ownership (TCO) of the imaging fleet. The TCO data should provide insight into pas
costs at the device level when possible and should be expressed as dollar figure. The

Page 3 of 6

cost elements that should go into the TCO calculation should include the cost of the
device, the cost of maintaining the device, the cost for supplies needed to print.
In addition to calculating the total cost of ownership of the fleet, the contractor shall
establish a cost per impression (CPI) using information on print volume derived from
legacy device meter reads. The CPI should communicate to the agency how much they
are spending on black and white and in color output.
The contractor may also assess the energy usage of a fleet or display or assess the
fleet from an environmental perspective using other environmental variables.
The Contractor shall further enhance the TCO calculations by identifying CPI for an
identified fleet. A CPI is calculated by identifying the TCO for an entire fleet over a se
period of time, and then dividing the TCO by the number of hard copy images produced
by that fleet over the same period of time. A CPI should be established for both black
and white (B&W) and color output.
The ordering activity shall identify to which degree it would like the CPI to be identified.
For example, a CPI might be required for each device within the fleet, or for each device
ype (e.g., copiers and printers) within a fleet.
Task F: Benchmark for Cost Reduction: The TCO and CPI benchmarks should be the
data components to which all progress toward cost reduction can be compared. The
Contractor shall propose a plan to assist in measuring progress towards lowering costs.
The Contractor is encouraged to offer the ordering activity tools that can be used to
assist the ordering activity’s progression. Any electronic tools such as software
packages or management databases shall be identified in the contractor’s offer.
Phase III: Future State Recommendations: As part of the assessment process, the
Contractor shall provide an estimated cost savings that can be achieved if the ordering
activity were to follow an optimization and right-sizing plan designed to achieve the
maximum potential from available resources. Such recommendations may include, bu
not necessarily be limited to, the relocation, removal, or disposal of legacy devices; the
addition of new devices; implementation of print behavioral changes etc.
Task G Optimization: Contractor will be required to provide the ordering activity with
recommendations for optimizing the existing fleet so as to use all existing devices to
heir maximum potential. The optimization process will include device placement within
environments where an appropriate number of users are mapped to a particular device
enabling higher utilization rates. The Contractor shall outline its approach to identifying
deficiencies within the existing fleet as well as potential areas for improvement. The
goal of the optimization process is to achieve maximum value from each of the existing
devices within the current fleet.
Right-Sizing Plan: In addition to optimizing the existing resources within a fleet, the
Contractor should be required to provide recommendations for right-sizing a fleet.

Page 4 of 6

Right-sizing will involve relocation, removal, and and/or disposal of certain devices, as
well as the potential addition of new devices.
All recommendations for device removal at the order level shall be accompanied with a
recommended disposal plan to assist the ordering activity in making decisions that will
mitigate negative environmental impacts.
All recommendations for new devices should be manufacturer-neutral. The
recommendations for new devices shall be identified based on machine functionality as
opposed to brand name make and model. If the ordering activity requests that a brand
name make and model be identified, the Contractor also shall identify all equivalen
makes and models available.
Contract Type: State the type of order i.e. Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials etc.
hat is applicable for this contract action. For information on contract types refer to FAR
Part 16.
Geographical Location/Place of Performance: Indicate all locations in which the
contractor is being asked to perform or state that it will be at the contractor’s facilities. If
necessary, identify the main location, and approximately how far away any secondary
locations are. Identify normal working hours and how you wish to address overtime or
extra hours.
Period of Performance: Indicate the length of this project by using one of the following
methods:
Method 1: Work to be performed in a specific time period with a period of performance
of five years or less. The base period for this order is from (insert the date and year)
hrough (insert the date and year) or one year from date of delivery and/or installation,
with four available twelve month option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the
government. Total of base period and option periods shall not exceed 5 years. The
exercising of the options should begin 60 to 90 days prior to expiration date.
Method 2: Multi-year period of performance - Used when the need for supplies or
services is non-severable and continuing over a period greater than one year. The
period of performance shall not exceed 5 years.
Site Visit: If applicable – provide site visit information. If a site visit is not required
please mark this section N/A or Reserved.

RFQ Considerations:
Carefully consider whether the Task Order will be procured using a Performance
Based Services approach. If the Contracting Officer intends to use Performance
Based Contracting methods the Contracting Officer must consider how to
implement and use a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. The Ordering Activity
may utilize a system of incentives and disincentives rather than a pass/fail
approach given their preferences.
The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer is responsible for developing the
methodology for evaluating order quotations. Some options to consider are:



Acceptable/Unacceptable Technical Offers that are the lowest price and
meet or exceed salient performance characteristics
Other technical factors are more highly valued by the government than price
