TASK A: MARKET RESEARCH
The contractor shall interview the government representatives to assess the need for
furnishings. The interview topics shall include functions, flexibility, adaptability, aesthetics,
durability, and sustainability. Based on the interview, the contractor shall make
recommendations to the government to visit showrooms that have furnishings that meet the
government’s needs. The showroom visits shall be used to inspect the manufacturers’ produc
lines and learn about product features and capabilities.
Prior to procurement implementation, FAR 8.602 market research must be completed.
Specifically, subpart (a)(1) requires that agencies (i.e. customer) do market research before
making the decision to use the GSA MAS program. The customer agency contracting officer
must make a unilateral written determination that furniture items from Federal Prison Industries
(FPI) (a/k/a UNICOR) are or are not comparable in terms of price, quality and time of delivery to
he commercial items(s) being sought in order to use the GSA MAS program. If the FPI items
are comparable in terms of price, quality and time of delivery to the commercial item(s) then the
FPI products must be purchased. FAR Part 10 contains policies and procedures for conducting
he required market research and provides useful information that relate to: a) publishing formal
requests for information, b) querying Government database of contracts, c) participating in online communication among industry and acquisitions personnel and customers, d) obtaining
source lists from other contracting agencies, e) reviewing catalogs and other generally available
product literature published by manufacturers or available on-line, and f) conducting interchange
meetings or holding pre-solicitation conferences, g) as well as other useful information.

Deliverables
After the showroom tours, the contractor will prepare a presentation summarizing the
product types and options that will meet the government’s requirements. The
presentation will include illustrations, documents and photographs showing furniture
styles that comply with the interior space design concept, as well as a section explaining
he advantages and disadvantage of each manufacturer’s solution to desired features.

TASK D: FURNISHINGS TECHNICAL PACKAGE
The contractor shall develop the documentation necessary for the Government to successfully
procure furniture and/or furnishings using a competitive award process.
The Furnishings Technical package may include the following components:
1. Performance Specifications
2. Quantity Estimates for each workspace and furniture type
3. Typical Workstations, Workspaces and Ancillary furnishings
4. Finish Selections
5. Evaluation Factors
At a minimum, the technical package shall include generic performance specifications for the
furnishings and estimated quantities of workspace or individual furnishing types. When modular
furniture products are required in the project, such as systems furniture or private office
casegoods, the technical package shall include typical workspace drawings and componen
listings.
The Typical Workstations, Workspaces and Ancillary Furnishings illustrate the furnishings with
plans and other drawings to convey to the furnishings vendors the desired arrangements and
elements necessary. The typicals are used for comparing furnishings contractors’ solutions and
pricing.
The Performance Specifications describe the minimum performance requirements, capabilities,
characteristics, features and level of quality of the furnishings required. The specifications
outline the services required to complete the project and how the offers will be evaluated.
The Quantity Estimates are used as the basis for the procurement item listing.
The Finish Selections are used as a guide to subsequent design decisions regarding materials,
colors and finishes for the new interior. The finishes help determine the offerors’ pricing by
establishing finish materials for the furniture (wood) laminate, etc.) and fabric grades.
The Evaluation Factors are used when the furniture procurement will be based on other than the
lowest priced offer. Quotations will be evaluated to determine which offers the best value to the
government.
The following describes each componen
Typical Workstations and Workspaces
The contractor shall develop typical workstation and workspace standards and drawings to
include plan views with dimensions, isometrics, furnishing descriptions, storage capacities,
accessories, lighting, electrical and data outlet requirements. The government shall identify the
ypes of workspaces that are considered "typical" to the government's use. The contractor shall
identify the requirements for each typical workspace, including component dimensions. The
contractor shall use a combination of the following tasks to define the typical workspace
requirements.

reusing the existing standards
interviews
inventories
survey
On-site observations

The interview and site survey are considered the most efficient and yielding the best results. If
he government has square footage (SF) standards for the staff workspace, this information will
be given to the contractor to include the SF in the final typical workspace plans.
It is not necessary or desired to develop a "typical workspace" for every unique condition. The
ypical workspaces should represent the overall majority of workstations by functional
requirement. Adding typical workspaces to accommodate columns, unique functional
requirements for one or two occurrences is not required for the technical package. Ideally,
ypical workspaces are designed to accommodate some flexibility in the use and assignment.
The contractor shall include quantities based on the number of typicals planned for the project.
Support space quantities will be based on actual counts from the space plan or ratio of spaces
o FTE.
Minimum Performance Specifications
At least three manufacturers on GSA Multiple Award Schedules must be capable of meeting the
specifications and those manufacturers and product lines should be indicated in the specifying
document presented to the government.
The contractor shall prepare a comparison of manufacturers/product lines and performance
criteria. The contractor will conduct the research necessary, based on the manufacturers'
product information, to confirm that three manufacturers meet all the mandatory performance
criteria. If a manufacturer does not meet the criteria, another manufacturer must be selected.
The performance specification shall be provided in a format that allows for easy comparison of
each vendor’s quote to the performance specification. The format shall include a reference area
for the vendor to indicate where the requirement is met in the vendor's submittal documents and
if confirmed by the contractor.
The contractor shall develop performance specifications listing the features, capacities and
capabilities required of the products to be acquired. The specifications shall include the
government's specific requirements. Specifications should not be broad-based, but instead
enumerate characteristics critical to the function of the product (e.g., cable capacity, functional
capability, etc. Do not include panel widths and thickness unless a specific width or thickness is
necessary for the performance of the product.). When a best value procurement will be
conducted, specifications may include desired product characteristics that are considered to add
value to the product. Specifications shall clearly distinguish between the mandatory
characteristics and the optional characteristics that add value but are not required. Supporting
explanations of how desired features add value shall be provided separately from the
specifications to aid the agency in evaluating competing offers.

Quantity Estimates
The Contractor shall provide an item listing with an estimated quantity for each workstation
ypical and individual product type required. Items shall be grouped by type.
Finish Selections
The Contractor shall select the color scheme and finishes for the typical workspace furniture.
The finishes set a quality level allowing other vendor offers to more accurately price the
furnishings desired by the Government. The finishes selected at this phase are not likely to be
he actual final finishes, but the finishes selected should represent an acceptable baseline for
he future. The finishes shall be used to guide project designers and help coordinate other
finishes, materials and colors that will become part of the project.
The contractor shall develop three (3) finish options to be presented to the government.
Prepare presentation board(s) or similar presentation style to show the furniture finishes for the
ypical workspaces.
After the preliminary presentation, the contractor will refine the finishes based on governmen
comments. Prepare a second presentation that reflects the refinements. Resubmit the
presentation materials with the refinements.
The government shall select and approve the scheme(s). The Contractor shall coordinate with
he government to make sure that all color schemes and finishes will not conflict with finishes in
other parts of the project.
After the second submission, the contractor will work with the government to resolve any
outstanding finishes selections. After resolution, prepare a final submission for the projec
record.
