# Product Requirements Document: Proactive Compliance Guardian System

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Author**: PRD Architect  
**Project**: AIKO - Adaptive Intelligence for Kontract Optimization  
**Research Reference**: R-001-proactive_compliance_guardian

## Executive Summary

The Proactive Compliance Guardian System represents a paradigm shift in government acquisition compliance management. Rather than reactive validation after document completion, this system provides real-time, contextual compliance monitoring during document creation. By leveraging interpretable machine learning with SHAP explanations, iOS Natural Language framework, and the existing AIKO infrastructure, the system delivers immediate, actionable compliance guidance while maintaining workflow continuity.

The system learns from user interactions through the existing LearningFeedbackLoop, continuously improving its accuracy and relevance. With a target response time of <200ms and a progressive UX hierarchy that minimizes workflow disruption, the Proactive Compliance Guardian transforms compliance from a burden into an intelligent assistant that enhances document quality and reduces acquisition cycle times.

## Objectives

2. **Contextual Warning System**: Provide non-intrusive, actionable compliance guidance 
3. **Continuous Learning**: Adapt to user patterns and feedback for improved accuracy
4. **Seamless Integration**: Enhance existing AIKO workflows without disruption

### Success Metrics
- **Response Time**: <200ms for real-time compliance feedback
- **Accuracy Rate**: >95% compliance detection accuracy within 90 days
- **User Satisfaction**: >85% positive feedback on warning helpfulness
