## AIKO Test Organization Complete

### Final Test Structure:
- **Unit/** - All unit tests organized by feature/module
- **Integration/** - Cross-module integration tests  
- **Performance/** - Performance benchmarking tests
- **Security/** - Security-focused test suites
- **UI/** - User interface and interaction tests
- **Documentation/** - Test documentation and reports
- **Utilities/** - Test runners, helpers, and validation scripts
- **Disabled/** - Temporarily disabled tests (review periodically)

### Platform-Specific Tests:
- **Unit/Platform/** - iOS/macOS specific unit tests

### Key Improvements:
1. ✅ Separated concerns by test type
2. ✅ Centralized documentation  
3. ✅ Isolated disabled tests for cleanup
4. ✅ Organized utilities and test runners
5. ✅ Consistent folder naming (PascalCase)
6. ✅ Clear separation of unit vs integration tests

### Recommendations:
- Review disabled tests quarterly for re-enablement
- Keep utilities updated with new test runners
- Maintain documentation as tests evolve
- Consider moving platform tests to separate targets
