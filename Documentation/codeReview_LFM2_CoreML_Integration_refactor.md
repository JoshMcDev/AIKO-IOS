## Handoff to QA Phase
QA Enforcer should validate:
1. **Functional Testing**: All 7 LFM2ServiceTests must pass without issues
2. **Performance Validation**: Ensure <2s per embedding, <800MB memory usage maintained
3. **Concurrency Testing**: Validate thread safety of new actor-based helpers
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure refactored components integrate properly
5. **Regression Testing**: Confirm no functionality was lost in refactoring
6. **Memory Management**: Test enhanced memory simulation system

## Final Quality Assessment
- **Architecture Quality**: EXCELLENT - Clean separation of concerns achieved

## Recommendations for QA Phase
1. **Priority 1**: Validate all 7 LFM2ServiceTests pass (functional verification)
2. **Priority 2**: Performance testing under load (memory and timing validation)
3. **Priority 3**: Concurrency stress testing (actor safety validation)
4. **Priority 4**: Integration testing with broader application context
5. **Priority 5**: Consider refactoring the 2 remaining long methods if time permits
