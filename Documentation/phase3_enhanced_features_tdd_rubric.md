- **LLMProviderSettingsView**: TCA to @Observable pattern migration

### VanillaIce Consensus Enhancements

Based on consensus validation, the following enhancements strengthen the TDD approach:

1. **Meaningful Test Focus**: Prioritize test quality over coverage percentage - tests must validate actual functionality and user scenarios
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Include user feedback loops in Definition of Done
3. **Automated Property Testing**: Integrate property-based tests into CI pipeline for continuous validation
4. **Enhanced Security Testing**: Specific tests for API key encryption, storage, and vulnerability scanning
5. **Performance Baselines**: Establish and monitor baseline metrics with regression detection
6. **Device Diversity Testing**: Automated cross-platform UI testing across multiple device configurations
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular rubric reviews based on team and user feedback
