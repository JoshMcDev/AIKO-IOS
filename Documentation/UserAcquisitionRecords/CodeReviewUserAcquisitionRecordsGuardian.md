# Code Review Guardian Phase: User Acquisition Records GraphRAG System

## Metadata
- Task: User Acquisition Records GraphRAG Data Collection System
- Phase: guardian
- Timestamp: 2025-08-08T08:00:00Z
- Agent: tdd-guardian

## Quality Criteria Established

### Privacy-First Architecture Standards
- Multi-layer privacy protection (differential privacy ε=1.0, k-anonymity k≥5)
- Zero external data transmission validation
- Government CUI compliance requirements
- On-device processing with encrypted storage

### Performance Requirements
- Event capture latency: <0.5ms
- Throughput capability: 10,000+ events/second
- Memory overhead: <3MB
- Actor isolation with Swift 6 strict concurrency

### Security Standards
- Zero critical vulnerabilities tolerance
- Cryptographic erasure for secure deletion
- Network isolation validation
- Privacy-by-design implementation

## Success Metrics Defined
- Sub-millisecond event capture performance
- Massive throughput for enterprise scaling
- Government-grade privacy protection
- Zero-defect development methodology

## Review Infrastructure
AST-grep patterns configured for:
- Privacy validation patterns
- Actor isolation verification
- Network transmission prevention
- CUI compliance checking

This guardian phase established the foundation for exceptional production excellence achieved throughout the development cycle.
