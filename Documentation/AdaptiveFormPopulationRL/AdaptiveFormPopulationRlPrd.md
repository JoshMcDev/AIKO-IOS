# Product Requirements Document: Adaptive Form Population with Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Executive Summary

The Adaptive Form Population system transforms the existing static FormIntelligenceAdapter into an intelligent, privacy-first system that learns from user behavior, provides context-aware suggestions, and continuously improves accuracy through on-device reinforcement learning. Leveraging MLX Swift for efficient on-device processing and the existing AgenticOrchestrator infrastructure, this system creates a personalized, adaptive form completion experience that respects user privacy while dramatically improving procurement workflow efficiency.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- **70%+ acceptance rate** (from ~50% baseline) through personalized learning
- **30% time reduction** in form completion through intelligent suggestions
- **100% on-device processing** ensuring complete privacy compliance
