## Metadata
- Task: Build Regulation Processing Pipeline with Smart Chunking
- Phase: guardian
- Timestamp: 2025-08-07T18:30:00Z
- Previous Phase File: none
- Agent: tdd-guardian

## Review Criteria

### Critical Patterns to Check
Based on requirements analysis, these patterns are critical:
- [ ] Force unwrapping in actor communication and HTML parsing operations
- [ ] Error handling for AsyncChannel back-pressure scenarios and memory overflow conditions
- [ ] Security validation for encryption/decryption operations and key management
- [ ] Input validation for HTML document processing and chunk boundary detection
- [ ] Authentication checks for secure enclave operations and keychain access

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Methods under 20 lines (strict enforcement for complex chunking algorithms)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 (especially critical for hierarchical parsing logic)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials (zero tolerance for security violations)
- [ ] Proper error propagation through AsyncChannel pipeline stages
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation for government HTML document variations

### SOLID Principles Focus Areas
Based on design complexity:
- [ ] SRP: StructureAwareChunker, MemoryOptimizedBatchProcessor, RegulationSecurityService isolation
- [ ] OCP: AsyncChannel pipeline extensibility for new document formats
- [ ] LSP: HTMLProcessor fallback mechanism substitutability
- [ ] ISP: Clear separation between chunking, embedding, and storage interfaces
- [ ] DIP: Dependency injection for SwiftSoup, Core ML, and ObjectBox abstractions

### Security Review Points
From requirements analysis:
- [ ] Input validation for: Government HTML documents, malformed content, encoding variations
- [ ] Authentication checks at: Secure enclave key operations, iOS Keychain access
- [ ] Authorization validation for: Key rotation operations, checkpoint persistence
- [ ] Data encryption for: Embedding vectors, checkpoint data, temporary processing files
- [ ] SQL injection prevention for: SQLite checkpoint persistence operations
- [ ] Memory safety for: Secure deletion protocols, cryptographic key handling

### Performance Considerations
Based on requirements:
- [ ] Async operations for: Document processing pipeline, embedding generation, vector storage
- [ ] Caching opportunities: Parsed HTML structure, chunk boundaries, embedding results
- [ ] Memory management for: 400MB constraint enforcement, batch processing optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization: ObjectBox HNSW index operations, checkpoint persistence

### Platform-Specific Patterns (iOS/macOS)
- [ ] Main thread operations validation for UI progress reporting
- [ ] Memory retention cycle prevention in actor communication
- [ ] SwiftUI state management patterns for progress visualization
- [ ] AsyncSequence/AsyncChannel pattern implementations
- [ ] Core ML thread safety and memory management

## AST-Grep Pattern Configuration
Verify these patterns exist in .claude/review-patterns.yml:
- force_unwrap (Critical - Zero tolerance for actor communication)
- missing_error_handling (Critical - Essential for pipeline resilience)
- memory_leak_potential (Critical - 400MB constraint enforcement)
- hardcoded_secret (Critical - Security requirement)
- unencrypted_storage (Critical - Government data protection)
- long_method (Major - Complexity management)
- complex_conditional (Major - Parsing logic clarity)
- solid_srp_violation (Major - Architecture integrity)
- solid_dip_violation (Major - Testability requirement)
- unvalidated_input (Major - Security and robustness)

## Metrics Baseline
- Target Method Length: < 20 lines (strict for chunking algorithms)
- Target Complexity: < 10 (especially for parsing logic)
- Target Test Coverage: > 95% (high due to government data sensitivity)
- Security Issues Tolerance: 0 (zero tolerance policy)
- Force Unwrap Tolerance: 0 (critical for actor safety)
- Critical Issue Tolerance: 0 (production readiness requirement)

## Requirements-Specific Patterns
Based on regulation processing pipeline analysis:

### Memory Constraint Patterns
- Memory allocation tracking for 400MB limit enforcement
- Mmap buffer overflow detection and handling
- Autoreleasepool usage for aggressive cleanup
- Memory pressure response mechanisms

### AsyncChannel Pipeline Patterns
- Back-pressure handling in pipeline coordination
- Bounded channel buffer management
- Actor isolation and thread safety
- Error propagation through pipeline stages

### Security Implementation Patterns  
- AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption operations
- iOS Keychain integration and key derivation
- Secure deletion and cryptographic erasure
- Envelope encryption with dual-key management

### Government Document Processing Patterns
- SwiftSoup HTML parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Structure-aware chunking with hierarchy preservation
- Token counting and boundary detection accuracy
- Character encoding handling (UTF-8, Latin-1, UTF-16)

### Checkpoint and Durability Patterns
- SQLite WAL checkpoint creation and recovery
- Dead letter queue processing and retry logic
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- State consistency during crash recovery

## Recommendations for Next Phase
Dev Executor should:
1. Run basic ast-grep patterns after achieving red tests (failing test creation)
2. Focus on memory constraint patterns first (400MB limit critical)
3. Document any AsyncChannel back-pressure issues without fixing
4. Create technical debt items for complex parsing refactor opportunities
5. Not fix issues during dev phase - only document them for subsequent phases
6. Reference this criteria file: codeReview_regulation-processing-pipeline_guardian.md

## Consensus-Enhanced Priorities

### Critical Priority (Immediate Attention Required)
1. **AsyncChannel Back-Pressure Testing**: Most critical gap identified by consensus
2. **Memory Constraint Enforcement**: 400MB limit with deterministic validation
3. **Security Pattern Validation**: Zero-tolerance for cryptographic vulnerabilities
4. **Government HTML Edge Cases**: Comprehensive document variation handling

### High Priority (Essential for Production)
1. **Long-Term Performance Monitoring**: Memory leak and performance drift detection
2. **Checkpoint Recovery Validation**: Complete durability guarantee enforcement
3. **Actor Concurrency Safety**: Re-entrancy and ordering bug prevention
4. **Encoding Variation Handling**: Character set and format diversity support

This code review framework ensures that all development phases maintain the highest quality standards while addressing the specific risks and requirements identified through comprehensive consensus validation.
