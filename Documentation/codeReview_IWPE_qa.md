## Critical Compilation Issues Resolution

### Swift 6 Actor Isolation Compliance
During QA validation, discovered and resolved critical compilation errors preventing test execution:

#### BiometricAuthenticationService Protocol Issues
- **Issue**: Missing protocol abstraction preventing proper mocking
- **Resolution**: Created `BiometricAuthenticationServiceProtocol` with proper `@MainActor` isolation
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/Users/J/AIKO/Sources/AppCore/Services/BiometricAuthenticationService.swift`
  - Added protocol with `nonisolated` methods for thread-safe access
  - Implemented proper Swift 6 concurrency patterns

#### Mock Service Implementation Issues  
- **Issue**: MockBiometricService could not inherit from final class
- **Resolution**: Protocol-based mocking with proper actor isolation
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/Users/J/AIKO/Tests/LLMProviderSettingsProtocolTests.swift`
  - `/Users/J/AIKO/Tests/Migration_TCAToSwiftUIValidationTests.swift`
  - Added `nonisolated(unsafe)` properties for mock state management

#### Cross-Platform Image Creation Issues
- **Issue**: Recursive function calls in `createMockImageData()`
- **Resolution**: Proper UIGraphicsBeginImageContext implementation
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/Users/J/AIKO/Tests/Security/Security_DocumentScannerTests.swift`
  - Added cross-platform `createMockSensitiveImage()` functions

#### Service Dependency Injection Issues
- **Issue**: Constructor expecting concrete type instead of protocol
- **Resolution**: Updated to accept protocol-based dependencies
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/Users/J/AIKO/Sources/AppCore/Services/LLMProviderSettingsService.swift`
  - Changed constructor to accept `any BiometricAuthenticationServiceProtocol`
