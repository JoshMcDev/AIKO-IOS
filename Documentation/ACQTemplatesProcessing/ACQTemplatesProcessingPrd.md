## Document Metadata
- Task: Implement Launch-Time ACQ Templates Processing and Embedding
- Version: Enhanced v1.0
- Date: 2025-08-07
- Author: tdd-prd-architect
- Consensus Method: zen:consensus synthesis applied
- Research Foundation: 5 comprehensive research documents (R-001-ACQTemplatesProcessing)

## Consensus Enhancement Summary
This PRD has been enhanced through multi-model consensus validation (Gemini-2.5-Pro, O3, O4-Mini) achieving 7.5/10 average confidence. Key improvements include: quantifiable success metrics, comprehensive edge case handling, memory constraint analysis, phased implementation strategy, and enhanced security specifications. Progressive learning features moved to Phase 2 based on consensus recommendation to reduce implementation risk.

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the implementation of a comprehensive acquisition template processing system that extends AIKO v6.2's existing GraphRAG infrastructure to support government contracting templates. Building on the completed Launch-Time Regulation Fetching system and ObjectBox Semantic Index, this feature will process 256MB of acquisition templates (contracts, forms, SOWs) from local test data, generate LFM2 embeddings for semantic search, and populate a dedicated ObjectBox namespace for enhanced document generation and user reference.

The system will provide government contractors with instant access to a searchable library of contract templates, SOWs, forms, and procurement best practices, significantly reducing document preparation time and improving compliance accuracy. Integration with existing regulation search creates a unified knowledge base for comprehensive acquisition support.

**Implementation Strategy:** Following consensus recommendations, this will be delivered in two phases - Phase 1 focusing on core template processing and search functionality, Phase 2 adding advanced features like progressive learning and structure-aware chunking.

## Background and Context

### Current State Analysis
AIKO v6.2 has successfully implemented foundational GraphRAG components:
- **Launch-Time Regulation Fetching**: Production-ready system processing GSA regulations ✅
- **ObjectBox Semantic Index**: Vector database with mock-first architecture ✅  
- **LFM2 Service**: On-device 700M parameter embedding model ✅
- **Regulation Processor**: Structure-aware chunking for government documents ✅

### Business Problem
Government contractors currently face significant inefficiencies in document preparation:
1. **Template Discovery**: Manual search through scattered government resources
2. **Compliance Risk**: Using outdated or inappropriate templates
3. **Time Inefficiency**: Recreating standard clauses and sections repeatedly

Extend the existing GraphRAG system to create a comprehensive template knowledge base that provides:
- Instant semantic search across 256MB of curated templates
- Template categorization (contracts, SOWs, forms, clauses)
- Cross-referencing between templates and regulations
- Enhanced form auto-population with template-aware suggestions
- Progressive template ranking based on user context and usage patterns (Phase 2)
