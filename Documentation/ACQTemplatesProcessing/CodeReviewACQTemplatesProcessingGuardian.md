## Review Criteria

### Critical Patterns to Check
Based on requirements analysis, these patterns are critical:
- [ ] Memory constraint violations (50MB strict limit enforcement)
- [ ] Actor isolation violations in Swift 6 strict concurrency mode
- [ ] Force unwrapping in memory-critical paths and search operations
- [ ] Error handling for memory pressure and processing failures
- [ ] Security validation for government template data handling
- [ ] Performance degradation in search latency (<10ms P50 target)
- [ ] Memory permit system bypass or improper usage
- [ ] Cross-actor data race conditions
- [ ] Embedding dimension inconsistency (384 vs 768)
- [ ] Unsafe memory operations in SIMD optimization code

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Methods under 20 lines (critical for memory management functions)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 (essential for search performance paths)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials (government data security)
- [ ] Proper error propagation with meaningful error types
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation for template metadata
- [ ] Memory cleanup and resource deallocation verification
- [ ] Thread-safe actor boundaries with proper isolation
- [ ] Consistent async/await usage throughout pipeline

### SOLID Principles Focus Areas
Based on memory-constrained design complexity:
- [ ] SRP: MemoryConstrainedTemplateProcessor should handle only processing, not storage
- [ ] SRP: HybridSearchService should handle search coordination, not embedding generation
- [ ] OCP: Search strategy extensible (lexical-only, hybrid, vector-only fallbacks)
- [ ] OCP: Template categorization patterns extensible for new document types
- [ ] LSP: All TemplateProcessor implementations must respect memory constraints
- [ ] LSP: All SearchService implementations must meet latency requirements
- [ ] ISP: MemoryPermitSystem interface segregated from processing logic
- [ ] ISP: Search result interfaces separate from internal ranking algorithms
- [ ] DIP: Depend on abstractions for LFM2Service, ObjectBox, and storage layers
- [ ] DIP: Template processing should not depend on concrete storage implementations

### Security Review Points
From government template processing requirements:
- [ ] Input validation for: template file formats (PDF, DOCX, MD), metadata extraction, file size limits
- [ ] Authentication checks at: template access points, search query endpoints, administrative functions
- [ ] Authorization validation for: user roles accessing different template categories, administrative operations
- [ ] Data encryption for: stored embeddings, cached template metadata, temporary processing files
- [ ] PII detection and redaction for: template content processing, metadata extraction, search indexing
- [ ] Secure memory handling for: embedding vectors, template content, user query data
- [ ] Access logging for: template access patterns, search queries, processing operations

### Performance Considerations
Based on strict performance requirements:
- [ ] Async operations for: template file I/O, embedding generation, database operations, search queries
- [ ] Caching opportunities: frequently accessed templates, category filters, embedding vectors
- [ ] Memory management for: large template processing (256MB), concurrent search operations, background processing
- [ ] Database query optimization: ObjectBox vector similarity search, category filtering, metadata queries
- [ ] SIMD optimization validation: cosine similarity calculations, vector operations on ARM64

### Platform-Specific Patterns (iOS/macOS)
- [ ] Main thread operations validation for UI updates and progress reporting
- [ ] Memory retention cycle prevention in actor references and closures
- [ ] SwiftUI state management patterns for search results and processing progress
- [ ] Combine publisher/subscriber patterns for real-time progress updates
- [ ] File system access patterns with proper sandboxing and security scopes
- [ ] Background processing coordination with iOS app lifecycle

### Memory-Specific Patterns (Critical for 50MB Constraint)
- [ ] Memory permit acquisition before any large allocations
- [ ] Proper permit release in all code paths (including error paths)
- [ ] Memory pressure response and graceful degradation
- [ ] Streaming processing without full document loading
- [ ] Memory-mapped file usage for large embedding storage
- [ ] Garbage collection coordination and memory cleanup
- [ ] Peak memory monitoring and alerting mechanisms

### Search Performance Patterns (Critical for <10ms Latency)
- [ ] BM25 prefilter implementation efficiency (<2ms target)
- [ ] Vector reranking optimization with SIMD (<8ms target)
- [ ] Cache warming strategies for frequently accessed categories
- [ ] Query preprocessing and optimization before search execution
- [ ] Result pagination and lazy loading for large result sets
- [ ] Search result caching and invalidation strategies

## Recommendations for Next Phase
Green Implementer should:
1. Focus on memory permit system implementation and validation first
2. Implement hybrid search with BM25 prefilter before vector reranking
3. Establish actor boundaries with proper Swift 6 isolation patterns
4. Create comprehensive mocking infrastructure for ObjectBox and LFM2Service
5. Implement streaming processing patterns before batch operations
6. Document memory usage patterns and permit acquisition strategies
7. Not fix performance issues during green phase - only document them
8. Create technical debt items for optimization opportunities
9. Reference this criteria file: codeReview_ACQTemplatesProcessing_guardian.md
