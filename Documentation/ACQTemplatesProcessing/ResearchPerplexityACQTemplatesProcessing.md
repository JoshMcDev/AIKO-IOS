**Query Executed:** iOS Swift best practices large-scale document processing 256MB government templates embedding generation ObjectBox vector database chunking strategies 2025

## Executive Summary
For large-scale document processing of 256MB government templates in iOS Swift by 2025, best practices emphasize efficient chunking strategies, optimized embedding generation, and ObjectBox vector database integration. Key findings include the importance of semantic chunking with balanced chunk sizes, streaming directly to vector databases to avoid intermediate disk writes, and leveraging Swift-native capabilities for performance optimization[1][2][3][4].

## Current Best Practices (2024-2025)

### 1. Efficient Chunking Strategies
- Use chunking to split large documents into manageable pieces, balancing *chunk size* and *overlap* to preserve context and improve embedding quality[4]
- Employ *character splitters* to segment text on logical boundaries such as paragraphs or lines, enhancing meaningful chunking for embedding generation[4]
- Keep chunk sizes optimized (neither too large to bloat memory nor too small to lose semantic coherence) and allow overlap between chunks to retain context across splits[4]

### 2. Embedding Generation and Vector Database Integration
- Generate embeddings for each chunk, ideally avoiding writing intermediary files to disk by streaming directly to a vector database[2][4]
- Leverage a fast, Swift-compatible vector database like *ObjectBox* that supports vector storage and querying for embedding vectors, enabling high-throughput similarity search within large document sets[2][4]

### 3. Swift and Modern iOS Development Practices
- Use **Swift** for all code to benefit from its performance, safety, and expressiveness improvements in 2025[1]
- Embrace Swift-native data handling and declarative UI with SwiftUI for interface components that support document visualization and user interaction[1]
- Adopt thorough automated testing (XCTest, XCUITest) and rigorous code reviews to ensure robustness and maintainability for complex data processing workflows[1]

## Technical Implementation Details

### Scalability and Performance
- Plan for memory and CPU efficiency given large document size (256MB). Avoid loading entire documents into memory; process incrementally using streaming or paging techniques where possible[3]
- Optimize embedding generation by batching requests to your embedding model or service
- Use cloud-native or hybrid architectures for scalability if document volumes grow beyond local device capacity, but for on-device solutions, leverage ObjectBox's lightweight embedded database capabilities[3]

### Data Quality and Continuous Learning
- Preprocess and cleanse government templates to ensure consistent input quality; remove noise and irrelevant metadata to improve embedding accuracy and search relevance[3]
- Implement monitoring and periodic retraining or updating of embedding models to adapt to evolving document formats or terminology[3]

## Code Examples and Patterns
While specific code examples weren't provided in the Perplexity response, the research indicates the following patterns should be implemented:
- Character-based text splitters for semantic boundaries
- Streaming architectures for chunk-to-embedding pipelines
- Batch processing for embedding generation
- Incremental memory management for large documents

## Security Considerations
- Implement secure document handling for government templates
- Use iOS file protection mechanisms for sensitive data
- Consider encryption-at-rest for stored embeddings
- Implement access control for template retrieval

## Performance Insights
- Chunk sizes should be tuned based on embedding model capabilities (typically 1024 tokens for llama-text-embed-v2, or 8196 for text-embedding-3-small)
- Batch embedding requests to reduce API calls and improve throughput
- Use ObjectBox's vector indexing capabilities for fast similarity search
- Implement progressive loading for user interface responsiveness

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Fixed-size chunking**: Simplest approach, suitable for uniform documents
2. **Semantic chunking**: More sophisticated, preserves contextual relationships
3. **Hybrid chunking**: Combines fixed-size with semantic boundaries
4. **Hierarchical chunking**: Maintains document structure relationships
