# Testing Rubric: Create Agentic Suggestion UI Framework

## Document Metadata
- Task: Create Agentic Suggestion UI Framework
- Version: Enhanced v1.0
- Date: 2025-08-05
- Author: tdd-guardian
- Consensus Method: Sequential thinking analysis applied (VanillaIce fallback used due to rate limiting)

## Consensus Enhancement Summary

This testing rubric has been enhanced through systematic sequential thinking analysis (VanillaIce fallback procedure). Key improvements include:

- **Enhanced Government Security Testing**: Added AI-specific security threats, FISMA compliance, and data classification security
- **Expanded Edge Case Coverage**: Government-specific scenarios, model drift detection, and device-specific edge cases
- **Strengthened Performance Testing**: Stress testing, scalability scenarios, and learning system performance validation
- **Improved Test Independence**: Better isolation strategies and dedicated test infrastructure requirements
- **Enhanced TDD Cycle Support**: Explicit Red-Green-Refactor phase specifications with quality gates
- **Bias and Fairness Testing**: Quarterly bias audits and demographic validation requirements

## Executive Summary

This testing rubric establishes comprehensive test-driven development specifications for the Agentic Suggestion UI Framework, building upon the consensus-validated PRD and implementation design. The framework emphasizes **trust through transparency**, **progressive disclosure**, and **user agency** - essential principles for government users requiring audit trails and explainable AI decisions.

**Key Testing Philosophy**: Every user interaction with AI suggestions must be validated through comprehensive test scenarios covering confidence visualization, reasoning explanation, feedback collection, and learning integration. Zero-tolerance approach for critical security, accessibility, and government compliance violations.
