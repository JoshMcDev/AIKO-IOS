  - Pattern: Complex view builder with multiple nested components
  - Refactor Action: Break into smaller, focused view components
- File: `/Users/J/AIKO/Sources/AgenticSuggestionUI/AgenticSuggestionView.swift:47-74` - loadSuggestions method
  - Severity: Major - Method with complex async logic
  - Pattern: Multiple async operations in single method
  - Refactor Action: Extract into smaller, focused async operations

#### Complex Conditionals: 1 found
- File: `/Users/J/AIKO/Sources/AgenticSuggestionUI/AgenticSuggestionView.swift:154-180` - suggestionActionsView

## Guardian Criteria Compliance Check
Based on codeReview_agentic-suggestion-ui_guardian.md:

### Critical Patterns Status
- [x] Force unwrap scanning completed - 0 issues documented
- [x] Error handling review completed - 3 issues documented  
- [x] Security validation completed - 1 issue documented
- [x] Input validation checked - 0 critical issues found (basic validation present)

### Code Quality Standards Initial Assessment
- [ ] Method length compliance: 2 violations documented
- [ ] Complexity metrics: 1 violation documented
- [ ] Security issue count: 4 critical issues found
- [ ] SOLID principles: 2 violations documented (SRP in AgenticSuggestionView)

### SOLID Principles Assessment
- [ ] SRP Violation: AgenticSuggestionView handles both display and feedback logic
  - File: `/Users/J/AIKO/Sources/AgenticSuggestionUI/AgenticSuggestionView.swift:251-291`
  - Pattern: View component handling business logic for feedback submission
  - Refactor Action: Extract feedback handling to dedicated service
- [ ] OCP Compliance: SuggestionViewModel extensible design ✅
- [ ] LSP Compliance: @Observable protocol properly implemented ✅
- [ ] ISP Compliance: Need separate protocols for display vs. feedback
- [ ] DIP Compliance: UI depends on protocol abstractions ✅

### Performance Considerations Assessment
- [x] Async operations properly implemented in SuggestionViewModel
- [x] Main thread UI updates properly managed with @MainActor
- [ ] Caching opportunities identified but not implemented (technical debt)
- [x] Memory management follows @Observable patterns

### Accessibility Compliance (Basic Check)
- [ ] Section 508 compliance: Needs comprehensive accessibility audit
  - Pattern: Basic accessibility labels present but not comprehensive
  - Refactor Action: Full accessibility implementation with VoiceOver testing
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast: Confidence indicator colors need validation
  - File: `/Users/J/AIKO/Sources/AgenticSuggestionUI/ConfidenceIndicator.swift:88-96`
  - Pattern: Color-based confidence indication without contrast validation
  - Refactor Action: Implement contrast validation and alternative indicators

## Technical Debt for Refactor Phase

### Priority 1 (Critical - Must Fix)
1. **Error Handling** at multiple locations - Replace print() statements with structured error handling
   - Pattern: Console logging without proper error propagation
   - Impact: Critical system failures may not be properly handled
   - Refactor Action: Implement comprehensive error handling strategy
   
2. **Secure Logging** at SuggestionViewModel:104 - Implement secure logging with data anonymization
   - Pattern: Plain text logging of sensitive suggestion data
   - Impact: Potential CUI data exposure in logs
   - Refactor Action: Implement secure logging framework

### Priority 2 (Major - Should Fix)  
1. **Method Decomposition** at AgenticSuggestionView:108-138 - Break down suggestionRowView method
   - Pattern: Complex view builder exceeding readability limits
   - Impact: Maintainability and testability concerns
   - Refactor Action: Extract sub-components and computed properties

2. **SRP Compliance** at AgenticSuggestionView:251-291 - Extract feedback handling logic
   - Pattern: View handling business logic responsibilities
   - Impact: Tight coupling and reduced testability
   - Refactor Action: Create dedicated FeedbackService

3. **Accessibility Implementation** across all UI components - Implement comprehensive accessibility
   - Pattern: Basic accessibility without full Section 508 compliance
   - Impact: Government compliance failure
   - Refactor Action: Full accessibility audit and implementation

### Priority 3 (Medium - Nice to Have)
1. **Performance Optimization** - Implement caching for confidence calculations
   - Pattern: Real-time calculations without caching strategy
   - Impact: Potential performance issues with large datasets
   - Refactor Action: Implement intelligent caching system

2. **Interface Segregation** - Create separate protocols for different aspects
   - Pattern: Large protocol interfaces with mixed responsibilities
   - Impact: Interface pollution and coupling issues
   - Refactor Action: Split into focused, single-responsibility protocols

## Review Metrics
- Critical Issues Found: 4
- Major Issues Found: 5
- Medium Issues Found: 2
- Files Requiring Refactoring: 3
- Estimated Refactor Effort: High

## Green Phase Compliance
- [x] All components compile successfully (100% build success)
- [x] Minimal functional implementation achieved
- [x] No premature optimization performed
- [x] Code review documentation completed
- [x] Technical debt items created for refactor phase
- [x] Critical security patterns documented
- [x] No fixes attempted during green phase

## Government Compliance Assessment
- [ ] **CUI Handling**: Logging patterns need secure implementation
- [ ] **Section 508**: Comprehensive accessibility audit required
- [ ] **FedRAMP**: Security logging and encryption patterns need enhancement
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: User interaction tracking needs implementation

## Handoff to Refactor Phase
Refactor Enforcer should prioritize:

1. **Critical Security Issues First**: 4 items requiring immediate attention
   - Error handling implementation (Priority 1)
   - Secure logging with data anonymization (Priority 1)
   - Accessibility compliance (Priority 2)
   - CUI data handling patterns (Priority 1)

2. **Code Quality Violations**: 5 items for maintainability
   - Method decomposition for readability
   - SRP compliance for better separation of concerns
   - Complex conditional simplification
   - Interface segregation implementation

3. **Government Compliance**: 4 items identified from guardian criteria
   - Section 508 accessibility implementation
   - WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast validation
   - Audit trail generation for user interactions
   - CUI data encryption and access controls

## Recommendations for Refactor Phase
Based on patterns found:
1. **Focus on critical security patterns first** (zero tolerance policy)
2. **Address method length and complexity** issues to improve maintainability  
3. **Implement proper error handling** throughout the component stack
4. **Review SOLID principle adherence** with emphasis on SRP violations
5. **Perform comprehensive accessibility audit** with government compliance testing
6. **Consider performance optimizations** after quality fixes are complete
