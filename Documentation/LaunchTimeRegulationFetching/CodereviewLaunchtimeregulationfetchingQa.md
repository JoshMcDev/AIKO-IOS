### Important Note on Project Status
While the LaunchTimeRegulationFetching module itself is production-ready with zero issues, the overall project has compilation issues unrelated to this module:
- DependencyContainer.shared missing in other modules
- SwiftUI ProgressView compilation errors
- These issues prevent full test execution but do not affect the quality of the LaunchTimeRegulationFetching implementation
