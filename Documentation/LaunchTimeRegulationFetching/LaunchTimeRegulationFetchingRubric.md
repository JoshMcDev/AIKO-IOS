## Executive Summary

This testing rubric defines comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) requirements for implementing Launch-Time Regulation Fetching in the AIKO iOS Government Contracting App. The feature enables automatic download, processing, and ObjectBox vector database population of official government regulations from the GSA acquisition.gov repository while maintaining strict performance constraints (<400ms launch time) through deferred background processing and streaming optimizations.

1. **Launch Performance Protection**: <400ms constraint with comprehensive telemetry
2. **Memory Management**: <300MB peak usage across device generations (A12-A17)
3. **Streaming Architecture**: JSON parsing with inputStream, checkpoint recovery
4. **Security Compliance**: SHA-256, certificate pinning, government data standards
5. **Production Resilience**: Error recovery, network interruptions, graceful degradation
