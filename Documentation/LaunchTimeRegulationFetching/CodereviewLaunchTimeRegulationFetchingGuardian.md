## Review Criteria

### Critical Patterns to Check
Based on requirements analysis, these patterns are critical:
- [ ] Force unwrapping in regulation processing, GitHub API interactions, and Core ML tensor operations
- [ ] Error handling for network failures, JSON parsing errors, memory pressure, and file corruption
- [ ] Security validation for certificate pinning, SHA-256 verification, and transport security
- [ ] Input validation for GitHub API responses, JSON parsing, and regulation content
- [ ] Authentication checks for API rate limiting, ETag caching, and secure transport

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Methods under 20 lines (critical for streaming and processing components)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 (especially for state machine and error handling)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API endpoints
- [ ] Proper error propagation with comprehensive error types
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation for external data sources

### SOLID Principles Focus Areas
Based on design complexity:
- [ ] SRP: RegulationFetchService, BackgroundRegulationProcessor separation of concerns
- [ ] OCP: Protocol-based dependency injection framework extensibility
- [ ] LSP: NetworkClientProtocol, ObjectBoxStoreProtocol, LFM2ServiceProtocol substitutability
- [ ] ISP: Focused protocols for GitHub, ObjectBox, LFM2, and networking services
- [ ] DIP: Complete dependency injection with TestDependencyContainer support

### Security Review Points
From requirements analysis:
- [ ] Input validation for: GitHub API responses, JSON regulation content, file metadata
- [ ] Authentication checks at: GitHub API integration, rate limit enforcement
- [ ] Authorization validation for: Repository access, file download permissions
- [ ] Data encryption for: Keychain credential storage, secure transport (TLS)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention for: ObjectBox queries, metadata filtering
- [ ] XSS prevention for: HTML regulation content processing and display

### Performance Considerations
Based on requirements:
- [ ] Async operations for: GitHub API calls, file downloads, LFM2 processing, ObjectBox operations
- [ ] Caching opportunities: ETag caching, regulation content, embedding vectors
- [ ] Memory management for: Core ML tensors, large JSON parsing, vector storage
- [ ] Database query optimization: ObjectBox similarity search, metadata filtering

### Platform-Specific Patterns (iOS/macOS)
- [ ] Main thread operations validation (@MainActor for UI updates)
- [ ] Memory retention cycle prevention (Core ML model lifecycle)
- [ ] SwiftUI state management patterns (@Observable, @Published)
- [ ] Background task management (BGProcessingTask lifecycle)
- [ ] Network monitoring patterns (NWPathMonitor integration)

## Requirements-Specific Patterns
Based on Launch-Time Regulation Fetching analysis:

### Launch Performance Protection
- [ ] No blocking operations on main thread during app launch
- [ ] Background task registration without UI blocking
- [ ] Deferred processing patterns for heavy operations
- [ ] Memory allocation optimization during launch sequence

### Streaming Architecture Security
- [ ] inputStream JSON parsing without memory accumulation
- [ ] Buffer management with size limits (16KB chunks)
- [ ] Checkpoint creation for resume capability
- [ ] Resource cleanup on cancellation or error

### GitHub API Integration Security
- [ ] Certificate pinning for api.github.com domain
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance with X-RateLimit headers
- [ ] ETag caching for efficient conditional requests
- [ ] SHA-256 verification for downloaded files

### Core ML Integration Safety
- [ ] Tensor memory lifecycle management with autoreleasepool
- [ ] Memory pressure detection and adaptive behavior
- [ ] Batch processing optimization (8-16 documents)
- [ ] Model warm-up strategies without blocking

### ObjectBox Database Security
- [ ] Transaction management for bulk operations
- [ ] Index building optimization with lazy construction
- [ ] Migration support across schema versions
- [ ] Corruption detection and recovery mechanisms

### Background Processing Resilience
- [ ] BGProcessingTask expiration handling
- [ ] State persistence across app sessions
- [ ] Progress tracking with 500ms intervals
- [ ] User cancellation with clean resource cleanup

### Device Compatibility Patterns
- [ ] Memory constraint adaptation for A12/A13 devices
- [ ] Performance profiling across device generations
- [ ] Network quality detection (cellular vs WiFi)
- [ ] Storage availability checks (2GB minimum)

## Recommendations for Next Phase
Green Implementer should:
1. Run basic ast-grep patterns after achieving green tests
2. Focus on critical security patterns first (certificate pinning, SHA verification)
3. Document any critical issues found without fixing
4. Create technical debt items for refactor phase
5. Not fix issues during green phase - only document them
6. Reference this criteria file: codeReview_launch-time-regulation-fetching_guardian.md
