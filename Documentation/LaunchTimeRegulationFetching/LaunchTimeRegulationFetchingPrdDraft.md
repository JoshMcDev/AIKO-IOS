# Product Requirements Document: Launch-Time Regulation Fetching

## Document Metadata
- Task: Implement Launch-Time Regulation Fetching
- Version: Draft v1.0
- Date: 2025-08-07
- Author: tdd-prd-architect
- Status: Initial Draft (Pre-Consensus)

## Executive Summary

The Launch-Time Regulation Fetching feature enables AIKO to automatically download, process, and populate the local ObjectBox vector database with official government regulations from the GSA acquisition.gov repository during the app's initial onboarding process. This ensures users have immediate access to comprehensive, semantically searchable regulatory content for intelligent form auto-population and compliance assistance, while maintaining the <400ms launch performance requirement through background processing.

## Background and Context

AIKO currently operates without a comprehensive local regulation database, limiting its ability to provide intelligent, compliance-aware form auto-population and decision support. The proposed solution addresses this by:

1. **Establishing Regulatory Foundation**: Creating a complete local repository of GSA acquisition regulations
2. **Enabling Semantic Search**: Processing regulations through LFM2 Core ML for vector-based similarity search
3. **Maintaining Performance**: Ensuring app launch remains responsive while populating database in background
4. **Supporting Offline Operation**: Providing full regulatory access without network dependency after initial setup

### Current Architecture Context
- **Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance** across all components
- **ObjectBox Semantic Index** vector database foundation complete (Mock-first architecture)
- **LFM2-700M Core ML model** integrated (149MB, production-ready)
- **TCA â†’ SwiftUI migration** completed with @Observable patterns
- **Zero SwiftLint violations** maintained across 587+ files

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As an acquisition professional**, I want AIKO to have immediate access to current regulations so that I can receive accurate, compliant form auto-population suggestions without manual research.

**As a first-time user**, I want the app to quickly set up its regulation database during onboarding so that I can start using intelligent features immediately without lengthy setup delays.

**As a government contractor**, I want confidence that AIKO's suggestions are based on official, current regulations so that my compliance efforts are reliable and auditable.

**As a mobile user**, I want the regulation database setup to not interfere with app responsiveness so that I can continue using other features while the background setup completes.

### Edge Case User Stories

**As a user with limited network connectivity**, I want the regulation fetch to gracefully handle interruptions and resume where it left off so that I don't lose progress from partial downloads.

**As a user with limited device storage**, I want clear visibility into database size requirements and the ability to manage storage so that regulation data doesn't overwhelm my device.

**As a security-conscious user**, I want assurance that regulation data is verified for integrity so that I'm confident in the authenticity of compliance guidance.

**As a user returning after months**, I want AIKO to automatically update outdated regulations so that my compliance guidance remains current without manual intervention.
