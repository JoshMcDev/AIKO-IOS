**2. LLM Provider Dependencies** (CRITICAL)
- **Risk**: Provider API changes, rate limits, or service outages
- **Enhanced Mitigation**: 
  - Comprehensive provider abstraction with 5+ fallback providers
  - Circuit breaker pattern for provider health monitoring
  - Local caching and offline mode capabilities
- **Tests**: Provider isolation tests, failover automation tests, rate limit handling tests
- **Contingency**: Maintain 3+ providers active simultaneously, implement graceful degradation

**3. GraphRAG On-Device Performance** (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- **Risk**: LFM2-700M model performance degradation on older devices
- **Enhanced Mitigation**: 
  - Device-tier performance testing (iPhone 12+, iPad Air 4+)
  - Adaptive model loading based on device capabilities
  - Fallback to cloud-based embedding for unsupported devices
- **Tests**: Device compatibility matrix, memory pressure tests, thermal throttling tests
- **Contingency**: Cloud fallback mode for devices with insufficient processing power

**4. Data Migration Integrity** (CRITICAL)
- **Risk**: User data corruption or loss during TCA→SwiftUI migration
- **Enhanced Mitigation**: 
  - Multi-point data validation during migration
  - Atomic migration transactions with rollback capabilities
  - Comprehensive data backup before each migration step
- **Tests**: Data integrity validation, migration rollback tests, backup/restore verification
- **Contingency**: Pause migration and restore from backup if data integrity issues detected

- **Enhanced Mitigation**:
  - Incremental actor adoption with comprehensive testing
  - Sendable conformance validation for all data types
  - Runtime concurrency violation monitoring
