## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Architecture Patterns

#### @Observable ViewModel Pattern
```swift
// Standard pattern for all business logic views
@Observable
final class [ViewName]ViewModel: Sendable {
    // State properties
    // Computed properties
    // Action methods
    // Service dependencies
}
```

#### Service Dependency Injection
```swift
// Views receive configured services
struct SAMGovLookupView: View {
    @Bindable var viewModel: SAMGovLookupViewModel
    @Environment(\.samGovService) private var samGovService
}
```

### 4.2 Data Models

#### SAMGovSearchEntry
```swift
struct SAMGovSearchEntry: Identifiable, Sendable {
    let id = UUID()
    var text: String = ""
    var type: SAMGovSearchType = .cage
    var isSearching: Bool = false
    var result: EntityDetail?
}

enum SAMGovSearchType: String, CaseIterable {
    case cage = "CAGE Code"
    case companyName = "Company Name" 
    case uei = "UEI"
}
```
