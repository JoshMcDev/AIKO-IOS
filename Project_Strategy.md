## Executive Summary

The AIKO iOS project faces a critical functionality crisis following TCA cleanup operations that disabled core user-facing features. With approximately 35% of functionality currently accessible and major user interface components non-operational, immediate emergency restoration is required before any strategic architectural initiatives can proceed.

### Core Philosophy: Unified Architecture with LLM-Powered Intelligence

**Let LLMs handle intelligence. Let iOS handle the interface. Let 5 Core Engines unify the architecture.**

By consolidating 90+ AI service files into 5 Core Engines (AIOrchestrator, DocumentEngine, PromptRegistry, ComplianceValidator, PersonalizationEngine) while migrating from TCA to native SwiftUI with Observable pattern, we deliver a dramatically simplified yet more powerful architecture that reduces the codebase by 48% while improving maintainability, performance, and development velocity.
